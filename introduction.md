# Introduction

The most common form of prostate cancer is a disease of the epithelial cells,
in this thesis we will often refer to prostate cancer, we will limit ourselves
to the prostatic adenocarinomy type. Epithelial cells line our body caveties,
our hollow organs and glands. The undergo rapid proliferation, mosty due to
damage. This proliferation increases the risk of genetic mutations, ultimetaly
increasing the risk of a cell uncontrollably dividing. This, in combination
with enabling factors of its tissue environment, can give rise to cancer.

In general, the more aggressive cancerous cells are, the less they will behave and
morphological appear like there original function. The prostate is a gland that
produces prostatic fluid. This fluid needs to be transported to the urethra via
tubes. These prostatic tubes, called prostatic glands, are lined with
epithelium. Low-grade cancer will thus mimick those gland structures.
High-grade prostate cancer looses its structural morphology, forming sheets of
cells, or even quasi-randomly dispersed individual cancerous cells.

The correlation between growth pattern and prognosis in prostate cancer was
systematically written down by American pathologist Donald Floyd Gleason, and
further coded into a scoring system by the National Institutes of Health in the
1966.
