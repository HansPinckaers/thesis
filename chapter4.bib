  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Despite revisions in 2005 and 2014, the Gleason
              prostate cancer (PCa) grading system still has major
              deficiencies. Combining of Gleason scores into a three-tiered
              grouping (6, 7, 8-10) is used most frequently for prognostic and
              therapeutic purposes. The lowest score, assigned 6, may be
              misunderstood as a cancer in the middle of the grading scale, and
              3+4=7 and 4+3=7 are often considered the same prognostic group.
              OBJECTIVE: To verify that a new grading system accurately
              produces a smaller number of grades with the most significant
              prognostic differences, using multi-institutional and multimodal
              therapy data. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Between 2005 and
              2014, 20,845 consecutive men were treated by radical
              prostatectomy at five academic institutions; 5501 men were
              treated with radiotherapy at two academic institutions. OUTCOME
              MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Outcome was based on
              biochemical recurrence (BCR). The log-rank test assessed
              univariable differences in BCR by Gleason score. Separate
              univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards used four
              possible categorizations of Gleason scores. RESULTS AND
              LIMITATIONS: In the surgery cohort, we found large differences in
              recurrence rates between both Gleason 3+4 versus 4+3 and Gleason
              8 versus 9. The hazard ratios relative to Gleason score 6 were
              1.9, 5.1, 8.0, and 11.7 for Gleason scores 3+4, 4+3, 8, and 9-10,
              respectively. These differences were attenuated in the
              radiotherapy cohort as a whole due to increased adjuvant or
              neoadjuvant hormones for patients with high-grade disease but
              were clearly seen in patients undergoing radiotherapy only. A
              five-grade group system had the highest prognostic discrimination
              for all cohorts on both univariable and multivariable analysis.
              The major limitation was the unavoidable use of prostate-specific
              antigen BCR as an end point as opposed to cancer-related death.
              CONCLUSIONS: The new PCa grading system has these benefits: more
              accurate grade stratification than current systems, simplified
              grading system of five grades, and lowest grade is 1, as opposed
              to 6, with the potential to reduce overtreatment of PCa. PATIENT
              SUMMARY: We looked at outcomes for prostate cancer (PCa) treated
              with radical prostatectomy or radiation therapy and validated a
              new grading system with more accurate grade stratification than
              current systems, including a simplified grading system of five
              grades and a lowest grade is 1, as opposed to 6, with the
              potential to reduce overtreatment of PCa.",

              Firstly, a well-performing survival model has minimal clinical
              application if it does not contribute to the stratification of a
              cancer patient cohort into different risk groups, preferably
              driven by histologic morphologies. In the clinical setting,
              individuals are not given specific prognostic predictions, but
              are rather predicted to lie within a risk group which has a
              general survival trend. Thus, It is imperative that a survival
              model produces well-stratified risk groups. Secondly, until now,
              survival modelling was done in a two-stage approach (encoding and
              aggregation). The massive amount of pixels in digitized whole
              slide images were never utilized to their fullest extent due to
              technological constraints on data processing, forcing decoupled
              learning. EPIC-Survival bridges encoding and aggregation into an
              end-to-end survival modelling approach, while introducing
              stratification boosting to encourage the model to not only
              optimize ranking, but also to discriminate between risk groups.
              In this study we show that EPIC-Survival performs better than
              other approaches in modelling intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, a
              historically difficult cancer to model. Further, we show that
              stratification boosting improves further improves model
              performance, resulting in a concordance-index of 0.880 on a
              held-out test set. Finally, we were able to identify specific
              histologic differences, not commonly sought out in ICC, between
              low and high risk groups.",

              hybridization analysis in a case-control study nested in The
              Johns Hopkins retropubic radical prostatectomy cohort. In all, 10
              tissue microarrays containing paired tumors and normal tissues
              obtained from 172 cases (recurrence) and 172 controls
              (non-recurrence) matched on pathological grade, stage,
              race/ethnicity, and age at the time of surgery were analyzed. All
              radical prostatectomies were performed at our institution between
              1993 and 2004. Recurrence was defined as biochemical recurrence,
              development of clinical evidence of metastasis, or death from
              prostate carcinoma. Each tissue microarray spot was scored for
              the presence of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and for ERG gene copy

              intervals were estimated from conditional logistic regression.
              Although the percentage of cases with fusion was slightly lower
              in cases than in controls (50 vs 57\%), the difference was not
              statistically significant (P=0.20). The presence of fusion due to

              duplicated ERG split, or ERG gene copy number gain with a single
              ERG fusion was not associated with recurrence. ERG gene polysomy
              without fusion was significantly associated with recurrence (odds

              (DLS) for predicting disease-specific survival for stage II and
              III colorectal cancer using 3652 cases (27,300 slides). When
              evaluated on two validation datasets containing 1239 cases (9340
              slides) and 738 cases (7140 slides), respectively, the DLS
              achieved a 5-year disease-specific survival AUC of 0.70 (95\% CI:
              0.66-0.73) and 0.69 (95\% CI: 0.64-0.72), and added significant
              predictive value to a set of nine clinicopathologic features. To
              interpret the DLS, we explored the ability of different
              human-interpretable features to explain the variance in DLS
              scores. We observed that clinicopathologic features such as
              T-category, N-category, and grade explained a small fraction of
              the variance in DLS scores (R2 = 18\% in both validation sets).
              Next, we generated human-interpretable histologic features by
              clustering embeddings from a deep-learning-based image-similarity
              model and showed that they explained the majority of the variance
              (R2 of 73-80\%). Furthermore, the clustering-derived feature most
              strongly associated with high DLS scores was also highly
              prognostic in isolation. With a distinct visual appearance

              tissue), this feature was identified by annotators with
              87.0-95.5\% accuracy. Our approach can be used to explain
              predictions from a prognostic deep learning model and uncover

                   study its mechanism in details. Pursuing the theory behind
                   warmup, we identify a problem of the adaptive learning rate
                   (i.e., it has problematically large variance in the early
                   stage), suggest warmup works as a variance reduction
                   technique, and provide both empirical and theoretical
                   evidence to verify our hypothesis. We further propose RAdam,
                   a new variant of Adam, by introducing a term to rectify the
                   variance of the adaptive learning rate. Extensive
                   experimental results on image classification, language
                   modeling, and neural machine translation verify our
                   intuition and demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness
                   of our proposed method. All implementations are available

               assessment models are needed to identify men who are at high
               risk for prostate cancer death early and who may benefit from
               aggressive salvage treatment and to identify men who are at low
               risk for prostate cancer death and can be safely
               observed.ObjectivesTo define risk factors for prostate cancer
               death following radical prostatectomy and to develop tables to
               risk stratify for prostate cancer--specific survival.Design,
               Setting, and PatientsRetrospective cohort study of 379 men who
               had undergone radical prostatectomy at an urban tertiary care
               hospital between 1982 and 2000 and who had a biochemical
               recurrence and after biochemical failure had at least 2
               prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values at least 3 months apart
               in order to calculate PSA doubling time (PSADT). The mean (SD)
               follow-up after surgery was 10.3 (4.7) years and median
               follow-up was 10 years (range, 1-20 years).Main Outcome
               MeasureProstate cancer--specific mortality.ResultsMedian
               survival had not been reached after 16 years of follow-up after
               biochemical recurrence. Prostate-specific doubling time (3
               years) were all significant risk factors for time to
               prostate-specific mortality. Using these 3 variables, tables
               were constructed to estimate the risk of prostate
               cancer--specific survival at year 15 after biochemical
               recurrence.ConclusionClinical parameters (PSADT, pathological
               Gleason score, and time from surgery to biochemical recurrence)
               can help risk stratify patients for prostate cancer--specific
               mortality following biochemical recurrence after radical
               prostatectomy. These preliminary findings may serve as useful
               guides to patients and their physicians to identify patients at
               high risk for prostate cancer--specific mortality following
               biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy to enroll
               them in early aggressive treatment trials. In addition, these

              oxidative DNA damage with risk of recurrence after surgery for
              localized prostate cancer. METHODS: We conducted a nested
              case-control study of men who had a radical prostatectomy in 1993
              to 2001. A total of 484 recurrence cases and 484 controls were
              matched on age, race, and pathologic stage and grade. Germline
              DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded unaffected lymph nodes.
              We genotyped candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in
              IL10, CRP, GPX1, GSR, GSTP1, hOGG1, IL1B, IL1RN, IL6, IL8, MPO,
              NOS2, NOS3, SOD1, SOD2, SOD3, TLR4, and TNF and tagging SNPs in
              IL10, CRP, GSR, IL1RN, IL6, NOS2, and NOS3. We used conditional
              logistic regression to estimate OR and 95\% confidence intervals
              (CI). RESULTS: The minor allele (A) in IL10 rs1800872, known to
              produce less interleukin-10 (IL-10), was associated with a higher
              risk of recurrence (OR = 1.76, 95\% CI: 1.00-3.10), and the minor
              allele (G) in rs1800896, known to produce more IL-10, was
              associated with a lower risk of recurrence (OR = 0.66, 95\% CI:
              0.48-0.91). We also observed associations for candidate SNPs in
              CRP, GSTP1, and IL1B. A common IL10 haplotype and 2 common NOS2
              haplotypes were associated with recurrence. CONCLUSION: Variation
              in IL10, CRP, GSTP1, IL1B, and NOS2 was associated with prostate
              cancer recurrence independent of pathologic prognostic factors.

              response and oxidation influence prostate cancer recurrence risk
              and suggests genetic variation in these pathways may inform

              million cancer deaths (9.9 million excluding nonmelanoma skin

              cancer as the most commonly diagnosed cancer, with an estimated
              2.3 million new cases (11.7\%), followed by lung (11.4\%),
              colorectal (10.0 \%), prostate (7.3\%), and stomach (5.6\%)

              colorectal (9.4\%), liver (8.3\%), stomach (7.7\%), and female
              breast (6.9\%) cancers. Overall incidence was from 2-fold to
              3-fold higher in transitioned versus transitioning countries for
              both sexes, whereas mortality varied <2-fold for men and little

              disease-free state lasting 5 years after treatment. We analyzed
              clinical and biochemical progression rates after radical
              prostatectomy for men with clinically localized prostate cancer
              with particular attention to recurrence beyond 5 years. Annual
              hazard rates of progression were calculated to determine the
              probability of recurrence at specific intervals following
              surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The records of 2,782 men with
              clinically localized prostate cancer (cT1-T2) undergoing radical
              prostatectomy between 1987 and 1993 were reviewed. All patients
              were treated in the prostate specific antigen (PSA) era so that
              serial followup PSA values were available from the time of
              surgery. Analysis was limited to patients who did not receive
              adjuvant treatment within 90 days of radical prostatectomy.
              Disease progression was defined as documented local recurrence,
              systemic progression and/or PSA 0.4 ng./ml. or greater. Lymph
              node positive cases were eliminated from analysis since almost
              all received adjuvant hormonal therapy. Annual hazard rates for
              progression were calculated using the formula: [No. events / No.
              patients at risk] x 100. Progression-free survival probabilities
              were determined using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS:
              Pathological stage was pT2a-b, N0 (68\%), pT3a, N0 (21\%) and
              pT3b, N0 (11\%). Biochemical progression-free survival at 5 and
              10 years was 76\% and 59\%, respectively, for the entire study
              population while those with pathologically organ confined (pT2,
              N0) cancers had progression-free survival rates of 82\% and 68\%
              at 5 and 10 years, respectively. A total of 819 patients (29\%)
              eventually had disease progression, including 160 (6\%) with
              progression after 5 years. Annual hazard rates were highest
              during the first 2 years after radical prostatectomy for the
              entire population. Patients with adverse prognostic features
              (pT3b, PSA 10 ng./ml. or greater, Gleason score 8-10 and
              nondiploid cancers) had high initial hazard rates that decreased
              with time to lower levels. Those with pathologically organ
              confined cancer had low but constant hazard rates throughout
              followup. CONCLUSIONS: Although progression after radical

  title    = "An update of the Gleason grading system",
  author   = "Epstein, Jonathan I",
  abstract = "PURPOSE: An update is provided of the Gleason grading system,
              which has evolved significantly since its initial description.
              MATERIALS AND METHODS: A search was performed using the
              MEDLINE(R) database and referenced lists of relevant studies to
              obtain articles concerning changes to the Gleason grading system.
              RESULTS: Since the introduction of the Gleason grading system
              more than 40 years ago many aspects of prostate cancer have
              changed, including prostate specific antigen testing, transrectal
              ultrasound guided prostate needle biopsy with greater sampling,
              immunohistochemistry for basal cells that changed the
              classification of prostate cancer and new prostate cancer
              variants. The system was updated at a 2005 consensus conference
              of international experts in urological pathology, under the
              auspices of the International Society of Urological Pathology.
              Gleason score 2-4 should rarely if ever be diagnosed on needle
              biopsy, certain patterns (ie poorly formed glands) originally
              considered Gleason pattern 3 are now considered Gleason pattern 4
              and all cribriform cancer should be graded pattern 4. The grading
              of variants and subtypes of acinar adenocarcinoma of the
              prostate, including cancer with vacuoles, foamy gland carcinoma,
              ductal adenocarcinoma, pseudohyperplastic carcinoma and small
              cell carcinoma have also been modified. Other recent issues
              include reporting secondary patterns of lower and higher grades
              when present to a limited extent, and commenting on tertiary
              grade patterns which differ depending on whether the specimen is
              from needle biopsy or radical prostatectomy. Whereas there is
              little debate on the definition of tertiary pattern on needle
              biopsy, this issue is controversial in radical prostatectomy
              specimens. Although tertiary Gleason patterns are typically added
              to pathology reports, they are routinely omitted in practice
              since there is no simple way to incorporate them in predictive
              nomograms/tables, research studies and patient counseling. Thus,
              a modified radical prostatectomy Gleason scoring system was
              recently proposed to incorporate tertiary Gleason patterns in an
              intuitive fashion. For needle biopsy with different cores showing
              different grades, the current recommendation is to report the
              grades of each core separately, whereby the highest grade tumor
              is selected as the grade of the entire case to determine
              treatment, regardless of the percent involvement. After the 2005
              consensus conference several studies confirmed the superiority of
              the modified Gleason system as well as its impact on urological
              practice. CONCLUSIONS: It is remarkable that nearly 40 years
              after its inception the Gleason grading system remains one of the
              most powerful prognostic factors for prostate cancer. This system
              has remained timely because of gradual adaptations by urological
              pathologists to accommodate the changing practice of medicine.",

               and their distinction requires visual inspection by an
               experienced pathologist. In this study, we trained a deep
               convolutional neural network (inception v3) on whole-slide
               images obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas to accurately and
               automatically classify them into LUAD, LUSC or normal lung

               pathologists, with an average area under the curve (AUC) of
               0.97. Our model was validated on independent datasets of frozen
               tissues, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues and biopsies.
               Furthermore, we trained the network to predict the ten most
               commonly mutated genes in LUAD. We found that six of
               them---STK11, EGFR, FAT1, SETBP1, KRAS and TP53---can be
               predicted from pathology images, with AUCs from 0.733 to 0.856

               that deep-learning models can assist pathologists in the
               detection of cancer subtype or gene mutations. Our approach can
               be applied to any cancer type, and the code is available at

  abstract = "Genomic aberrations of the PTEN tumour suppressor gene are among
              the most common in prostate cancer. Inactivation of PTEN by
              deletion or mutation is identified in ∼20\% of primary prostate
              tumour samples at radical prostatectomy and in as many as 50\% of
              castration-resistant tumours. Loss of phosphatase and tensin
              homologue (PTEN) function leads to activation of the PI3K-AKT
              (phosphoinositide 3-kinase-RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein
              kinase) pathway and is strongly associated with adverse
              oncological outcomes, making PTEN a potentially useful genomic
              marker to distinguish indolent from aggressive disease in
              patients with clinically localized tumours. At the other end of
              the disease spectrum, therapeutic compounds targeting nodes in
              the PI3K-AKT-mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) signalling
              pathway are being tested in clinical trials for patients with
              metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Knowledge of
              PTEN status might be helpful to identify patients who are more
              likely to benefit from these therapies. To enable the use of PTEN
              status as a prognostic and predictive biomarker, analytically
              validated assays have been developed for reliable and
              reproducible detection of PTEN loss in tumour tissue and in blood
              liquid biopsies. The use of clinical-grade assays in tumour
              tissue has shown a robust correlation between loss of PTEN and
              its protein as well as a strong association between PTEN loss and
              adverse pathological features and oncological outcomes. In
              advanced disease, assessing PTEN status in liquid biopsies shows
              promise in predicting response to targeted therapy. Finally,
              studies have shown that PTEN might have additional functions that
              are independent of the PI3K-AKT pathway, including those
              affecting tumour growth through modulation of the immune response
              and tumour microenvironment.",

              clinically localized prostate cancer, 412 men (17\%) have

              9.7\%, whereas 1.7\% and 5.8\% had local recurrence and distant
              metastasis, respectively. The overall actuarial 5-, 10-, and
              15-year recurrence-free survival rates for these men were 84\%,
              74\%, and 66\%, respectively. As demonstrated in the authors'

              recurrence increased with advancing clinical stage,
              Gleason-score, preoperative PSA level, and pathologic stage.
              Subdivision of men with Gleason 7 tumors resulted in better
              stratification. There was a similar actuarial likelihood of
              postoperative recurrence for men with Gleason 4 + 3 and Gleason
              score 8 to 10 disease. The actuarial rate of recurrence of tumor
              for men with Gleason 3 + 4 disease was statistically different
              from the rate for men with Gleason score 6 or Gleason 4 + 3
              disease. The overall actuarial metastasis-free survival rates at
              5, 10, and 15 years were 96\%, 90\%, and 82\%, respectively. The
              overall actuarial cancer-specific survival rates at 5, 10, and 15

              in comparing these results with the outcomes for cohorts of
              patients treated since 1989. Anatomic RRP is an effective way to
              manage clinically localized prostate cancer. Excellent long-term
              results can be obtained with RRP for early stage disease. The
              proportion of men with early stage prostate cancer will continue

              presence of intraductal carcinoma, and evaluated biochemical

                   trained using variants of stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
                   algorithms. Recent attempts to improve SGD can be broadly
                   categorized into two approaches: (1) adaptive learning rate
                   schemes, such as AdaGrad and Adam, and (2) accelerated
                   schemes, such as heavy-ball and Nesterov momentum. In this
                   paper, we propose a new optimization algorithm, Lookahead,
                   that is orthogonal to these previous approaches and
                   iteratively updates two sets of weights. Intuitively, the
                   algorithm chooses a search direction by looking ahead at the
                   sequence of fast weights generated by another optimizer. We
                   show that Lookahead improves the learning stability and
                   lowers the variance of its inner optimizer with negligible
                   computation and memory cost. We empirically demonstrate
                   Lookahead can significantly improve the performance of SGD

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to evaluate the
              reproducibility of the Gleason grading system and to compare its
              interobserver variability with the novel Gleason grade grouping
              proposal using a large sample volume. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In
              total, 407 pathology slides of prostate needle biopsies from 34
              consecutive patients with prostate cancer were re-evaluated. The
              International Society of Urological Pathology 2005 modified
              Gleason grading system with Epstein's modification was used. Two
              pathologists, blind to each other and to the initial pathology
              report, performed the pathological evaluation. To determine
              interobserver concordance, the kappa ($\kappa$) coefficient test
              was used. RESULTS: Pathologist 1 and pathologist 2 detected a
              tumor in 202 and 231 cores, respectively (p < 0.001). The two
              pathologists disagreed on the presence of a tumor in 31 cores. Of
              these 31 cores, 74\% (n = 23/31) were Gleason pattern 3. The mean
              length of the cancer foci in these 31 disputed cores was 1.54
              $\pm$ 0.8 mm. Concordance rates between the two observers for
              primary and secondary Gleason patterns were 63.96\% ($\kappa$ =
              0.34) and 63.45\% ($\kappa$ = 0.37), respectively. Concordance
              with respect to the Gleason sum was 57.9\% ($\kappa$ = 0.43).
              When the Gleason scores were classified into the novel Gleason
              grade grouping, concordance was found to be 51.7\% ($\kappa$ =
              0.39). CONCLUSIONS: The agreement between observers on the
              Gleason sum was moderate. The novel Gleason grade grouping did
              not improve interobserver agreement. Further studies are needed
              to confirm these results on interobserver variability.",

              guidelines on screening, diagnosis, and local treatment of
              clinically localised prostate cancer (PCa). Evidence acquisition
              The panel performed a literature review of new data, covering the
              time frame between 2016 and 2020. The guidelines were updated and
              a strength rating for each recommendation was added based on a
              systematic review of the evidence. Evidence synthesis A
              risk-adapted strategy for identifying men who may develop PCa is
              advised, generally commencing at 50 yr of age and based on
              individualised life expectancy. Risk-adapted screening should be
              offered to men at increased risk from the age of 45 yr and to
              breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA) mutation carriers, who
              have been confirmed to be at risk of early and aggressive disease
              (mainly BRAC2), from around 40 yr of age. The use of
              multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in order to avoid
              unnecessary biopsies is recommended. When a biopsy is performed,
              a combination of targeted and systematic biopsies must be
              offered. There is currently no place for the routine use of
              tissue-based biomarkers. Whilst prostate-specific membrane
              antigen positron emission tomography computed tomography is the
              most sensitive staging procedure, the lack of outcome benefit
              remains a major limitation. Active surveillance (AS) should
              always be discussed with low-risk patients, as well as with
              selected intermediate-risk patients with favourable International
              Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) 2 lesions. Local therapies
              are addressed, as well as the AS journey and the management of
              persistent prostate-specific antigen after surgery. A strong
              recommendation to consider moderate hypofractionation in
              intermediate-risk patients is provided. Patients with cN1 PCa
              should be offered a local treatment combined with long-term
              hormonal treatment. Conclusions The evidence in the field of
              diagnosis, staging, and treatment of localised PCa is evolving
              rapidly. The 2020 EAU-EANM-ESTRO-ESUR-SIOG guidelines on PCa
              summarise the most recent findings and advice for their use in
              clinical practice. These PCa guidelines reflect the
              multidisciplinary nature of PCa management. Patient summary
              Updated prostate cancer guidelines are presented, addressing
              screening, diagnosis, and local treatment with curative intent.
              These guidelines rely on the available scientific evidence, and
              new insights will need to be considered and included on a regular
              basis. In some cases, the supporting evidence for new treatment
              options is not yet strong enough to provide a recommendation,
              which is why continuous updating is important. Patients must be
              fully informed of all relevant options and, together with their
              treating physicians, decide on the most optimal management for
              them.",

                   powerful representational spaces, which are necessary for
                   tackling complex learning tasks. However, due to the model
                   capacity required to capture such representations, they are
                   often susceptible to overfitting and therefore require
                   proper regularization in order to generalize well. In this

                   randomly masking out square regions of input during
                   training, which we call cutout, can be used to improve the

              as to the diagnosis of cribriform patterns, the ISUP assembled an
              international panel of 12 expert urogenital pathologists for the
              purpose of drafting a consensus definition of cribriform pattern
              in prostate cancer, and provide their opinions on a set of 32
              images and on potential diagnostic criteria. These images were
              selected by the 2 nonvoting convenors of the study and included
              the main categories where disagreement was anticipated. The
              Delphi method was applied to promote consensus among the 12
              panelists in their review of the images during 2 initial rounds
              of the study. Following a virtual meeting, convened to discuss
              selected images and diagnostic criteria, the following definition
              for cribriform pattern in prostate cancer was approved: ``A
              confluent sheet of contiguous malignant epithelial cells with
              multiple glandular lumina that are easily visible at low power
              (objective magnification $\times$10). There should be no
              intervening stroma or mucin separating individual or fused
              glandular structures'' together with a set of explanatory notes.
              We believe this consensus definition to be practical and that it
              will facilitate reproducible recognition and reporting of this
              clinically important pattern commonly seen in prostate cancer.

              or at least ordinal variables. In order to translate a continuous
              variable into a clinical decision, it is necessary to determine a
              cutoff point and to stratify patients into two groups each
              requiring a different kind of treatment. Currently, there is no
              standard method or standard software for biomarker cutoff
              determination. Therefore, we developed Cutoff Finder, a bundle of
              optimization and visualization methods for cutoff determination
              that is accessible online. While one of the methods for cutoff
              optimization is based solely on the distribution of the marker
              under investigation, other methods optimize the correlation of
              the dichotomization with respect to an outcome or survival
              variable. We illustrate the functionality of Cutoff Finder by the
              analysis of the gene expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and
              progesterone receptor (PgR) in breast cancer tissues. This
              distribution of these important markers is analyzed and
              correlated with immunohistologically determined ER status and
              distant metastasis free survival. Cutoff Finder is expected to
              fill a relevant gap in the available biometric software
              repertoire and will enable faster optimization of new diagnostic
              biomarkers. The tool can be accessed at

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Incidence density sampling is typically the least
              biased efficient method for control sampling in nested
              case-control studies. However, in studies of genetic variants and
              prostate cancer progression, some argue that controls should be
              sampled from men who did not progress by end of follow-up. Thus,
              we examined the validity of relative risk (RR) estimates of
              prostate cancer progression using three methods for control
              sampling from cohorts of men with prostate cancer generated by
              Monte Carlo simulation. METHODS: Data were simulated for nine
              scenarios for combinations of genotype frequency (10\%, 30\%, and
              50\%) and association (RR, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0) using prostate
              progression rates from Johns Hopkins Hospital. RRs estimated from
              conditional logistic regression for the genetic association from
              case-control studies nested in the nine cohort scenarios using
              three control sampling methods, (a) incidence density sampling,
              (b) incidence density sampling without replacement of selected
              controls, and (c) ``pure'' control sampling (i.e., men who did
              not progress by end of long-term follow-up), were compared with
              the true RRs. RESULTS: Use of controls selected by incidence
              density sampling produced unbiased RR estimates of progression.
              In our setting, only a slight bias was produced by use of
              incidence density sampling without replacement. In contrast, use
              of controls selected by pure control sampling produced biased RR
              estimates, except when there was no association; extent of bias
              increased with increasing size of the association and duration of
              follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Nested case-control studies designed to
              estimate the association of genetic variants with risk of
              prostate cancer progression should use incidence density sampling
              to provide a valid RR estimate.",

  abstract = "Importance: In the United States, the lifetime risk of being
              diagnosed with prostate cancer is approximately 13\%, and the
              lifetime risk of dying of prostate cancer is 2.5\%. The median
              age of death from prostate cancer is 80 years. Many men with
              prostate cancer never experience symptoms and, without screening,
              would never know they have the disease. African American men and
              men with a family history of prostate cancer have an increased
              risk of prostate cancer compared with other men. Objective: To
              update the 2012 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)
              recommendation on prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening
              for prostate cancer. Evidence Review: The USPSTF reviewed the
              evidence on the benefits and harms of PSA-based screening for
              prostate cancer and subsequent treatment of screen-detected
              prostate cancer. The USPSTF also commissioned a review of
              existing decision analysis models and the overdiagnosis rate of
              PSA-based screening. The reviews also examined the benefits and
              harms of PSA-based screening in patient subpopulations at higher
              risk of prostate cancer, including older men, African American
              men, and men with a family history of prostate cancer. Findings:
              Adequate evidence from randomized clinical trials shows that
              PSA-based screening programs in men aged 55 to 69 years may
              prevent approximately 1.3 deaths from prostate cancer over
              approximately 13 years per 1000 men screened. Screening programs
              may also prevent approximately 3 cases of metastatic prostate
              cancer per 1000 men screened. Potential harms of screening
              include frequent false-positive results and psychological harms.
              Harms of prostate cancer treatment include erectile dysfunction,
              urinary incontinence, and bowel symptoms. About 1 in 5 men who
              undergo radical prostatectomy develop long-term urinary
              incontinence, and 2 in 3 men will experience long-term erectile
              dysfunction. Adequate evidence shows that the harms of screening
              in men older than 70 years are at least moderate and greater than
              in younger men because of increased risk of false-positive
              results, diagnostic harms from biopsies, and harms from
              treatment. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the
              net benefit of PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in men
              aged 55 to 69 years is small for some men. How each man weighs
              specific benefits and harms will determine whether the overall
              net benefit is small. The USPSTF concludes with moderate
              certainty that the potential benefits of PSA-based screening for
              prostate cancer in men 70 years and older do not outweigh the
              expected harms. Conclusions and Recommendation: For men aged 55
              to 69 years, the decision to undergo periodic PSA-based screening
              for prostate cancer should be an individual one and should
              include discussion of the potential benefits and harms of
              screening with their clinician. Screening offers a small
              potential benefit of reducing the chance of death from prostate
              cancer in some men. However, many men will experience potential
              harms of screening, including false-positive results that require
              additional testing and possible prostate biopsy; overdiagnosis
              and overtreatment; and treatment complications, such as
              incontinence and erectile dysfunction. In determining whether
              this service is appropriate in individual cases, patients and
              clinicians should consider the balance of benefits and harms on
              the basis of family history, race/ethnicity, comorbid medical
              conditions, patient values about the benefits and harms of
              screening and treatment-specific outcomes, and other health
              needs. Clinicians should not screen men who do not express a
              preference for screening. (C recommendation) The USPSTF
              recommends against PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in men
              70 years and older. (D recommendation).",

               hope that creating methods for explaining these black box models
               will alleviate some of the problems, but trying to explain black
               box models, rather than creating models that are interpretable
               in the first place, is likely to perpetuate bad practice and can
               potentially cause great harm to society. The way forward is to
               design models that are inherently interpretable. This
               Perspective clarifies the chasm between explaining black boxes
               and using inherently interpretable models, outlines several key
               reasons why explainable black boxes should be avoided in

               There has been a recent rise of interest in developing methods

              institution has performed quantitation of prostate cancer DNA
              ploidy and Ki-67 (MIB-1) on most prostate cancer needle biopsy
              specimens. The outcomes of 451 consecutive patients with
              biopsy-proven cancer treated by radical prostatectomy between
              January 24, 1995, and December 29, 1998, without neoadjuvant
              hormonal therapy were assessed. Clinical and biopsy information
              obtained before radical prostatectomy was placed in multivariate
              Cox proportional hazards regression models to predict local or
              systemic progression and cancer-specific death. Predictive
              ability was evaluated using a concordance index. RESULTS: With a
              median follow-up of 12.9 years, 46 patients experienced local or
              systemic progression, and 18 patients died of prostate cancer. On
              multivariate analysis, the biopsy features of Ki-67 expression,
              perineural invasion, and Gleason score were associated with local
              or systemic progression. Ki-67 expression, perineural invasion,
              and Gleason score were associated with cancer-specific death with
              a concordance index of 0.892. After adjusting for perineural
              invasion and Gleason score, each 1\% increase in Ki-67 expression
              was associated with a 12\% increased risk of cancer-specific
              death (P<.001). Ki-67 expression alone was a strong predictor of
              cancer-specific outcomes and improved the predictive ability of
              currently used algorithms. CONCLUSION: This study documents that
              long-term prostate cancer outcomes are best estimated with a
              combination of Gleason score, perineural invasion, and Ki-67
              expression. Given its low cost, rapid assessment, and strong
              predictive power, we believe that adding Ki-67 expression to
              perineural invasion and Gleason score at biopsy should be
              considered a standard by which all new biomarkers are compared
              before introducing them into clinical practice.",

              decision-making in prostate cancer. Recently, percent Gleason
              pattern 4 and presence of invasive cribriform and/or intraductal
              carcinoma (CR/IDC) have been recognized for their independent
              predictive value for prostate cancer outcome. There is sparse
              data on the inter-observer agreement for these pathologic
              features in practice. Our objectives were to investigate
              inter-observer variability of percent Gleason pattern and CR/IDC
              and to relate individual tumour scores to clinical outcome. Our
              cohort included 80 consecutive radical prostatectomies with a
              median follow-up 87.1 months (interquartile range 43.3-119.2), of
              which the slide with largest tumour volume was scored by six
              pathologists for Grade group (four tiers: 1, 2, 3 and 4/5),
              percent Gleason pattern 4 (four tiers: 0-25\%, 26-50\%, 51-75\%
              and 76-100\%) and presence of CR/IDC (two tiers: absent,
              present). The individual assignments were related to
              post-operative biochemical recurrence (20/80). Inter-observer
              agreement was substantial (Krippendorff's $\alpha$ 0.626) for
              assessment of Grade group and moderate for CR/IDC ($\alpha$
              0.507) and percent Gleason pattern 4 ($\alpha$ 0.551). For each
              individual pathologist, biochemical recurrence rates incremented
              by Grade group and presence of CR/IDC, although such relation was
              less clear for percent Gleason pattern 4. In conclusion,
              inter-observer agreement for CR/IDC and percent Gleason pattern 4
              is lower than for Grade groups, indicating awareness of these
              features needs further improvement. Grade group and CR/IDC, but
              not percent Gleason pattern 4 was related to biochemical
              recurrence for each pathologist, indicating overall validity of
              individual grade assignments despite inter-observer variability.",

  abstract = "UNLABELLED: WHAT'S KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT? AND WHAT DOES THE STUDY
              ADD?: The Gleason scoring system is a well-established predictor
              of pathological stage and oncological outcomes for men with
              prostate cancer. Modifications throughout the last few decades -
              most recently by the International Society of Urological
              Pathology (ISUP) in 2005 - have attempted to improve the
              correlation between biopsy and radical prostatectomy Gleason sum
              and better stratify patients to predict clinical outcomes. Based
              on these clinical outcomes and the excellent prognosis for
              patients with low Gleason scores, we recommend Gleason grades
              incorporating a prognostic grade grouping which accurately
              reflect prognosis and are clearly understood by physicians and
              patients alike. OBJECTIVE: To investigate pathological and
              short-term outcomes since the most recent Gleason system
              modifications by the International Society of Urological
              Pathology (ISUP) in an attempt to divide the current Gleason
              grading system into prognostically accurate Gleason grade groups.
              PATIENTS AND METHODS: We queried the Johns Hopkins Radical
              Prostatectomy Database (1982-2011), approved by the institutional
              review board, for men undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP)
              without a tertiary pattern since 2004 and identified 7869 men.
              Multivariable models were created using preoperative and
              postoperative variables; prognostic grade group (Gleason grade
              $\leq$ 6; 3 + 4; 4 + 3; 8; 9-10) was among the strongest
              predictors of biochemical recurrence-free (BFS) survival.
              RESULTS: Significant differences were noted among the Gleason
              grade groups at biopsy; differences were noted in the race, PSA
              level, clinical stage, number of positive cores at biopsy and the
              maximum percentage of positive cores among the Gleason grade
              groups at RP. With a median (range) follow-up of 2 (1-7) years,
              5-year BFS rates for men with Gleason grade $\leq$ 6, 3 + 4, 4 +
              3, 8 and 9-10 tumours at biopsy were 94.6, 82.7, 65.1, 63.1 and
              34.5\%, respectively (P < 0.001 for trend); and 96.6, 88.1, 69.7,
              63.7 and 34.5\%, respectively (P < 0.001), based on RP pathology.
              CONCLUSIONS: The 2005 ISUP modifications to the Gleason grading
              system for prostate carcinoma accurately categorize patients by
              pathological findings and short-term biochemical outcomes but,
              while retaining the essence of the Gleason system, there is a
              need for a change in its reporting to more closely reflect tumour
              behaviour. We propose reporting Gleason grades, including
              prognostic grade groups which accurately reflect prognosis as
              follows: Gleason score $\leq$ 6 (prognostic grade group I);
              Gleason score 3+4=7 (prognostic grade group II); Gleason score
              4+3=7 (prognostic grade group III); Gleason score 4+4=8
              (prognostic grade group (IV); and Gleason score 9-10 (prognostic
              grade group (V).",
