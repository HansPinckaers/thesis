title: Streaming convolutional neural networks for end-to-end learning
  with multi-megapixel images
abstract: |
  **Background\:** The first sign of metastatic prostate cancer after
  radical prostatectomy is rising PSA levels in the blood, termed
  biochemical recurrence. The prediction of recurrence relies mainly on
  the morphological assessment of prostate cancer using the Gleason
  grading system. However, in this system, within-grade morphological
  patterns and subtle histopathological features are currently omitted,
  leaving a significant amount of prognostic potential unexplored.

  **Methods\:** To discover additional prognostic information using
  artificial intelligence, we trained a deep learning system to predict
  biochemical recurrence from tissue in H&E-stained microarray cores
  directly. We developed a morphological biomarker using convolutional
  neural networks leveraging a nested case-control study of 685 patients
  and validated on an independent cohort of 204 patients. We use
  concept-based explainability methods to interpret the learned tissue
  patterns.

  **Results\:** The biomarker provides a strong correlation with
  biochemical recurrence in two sets (n=182 and n=204) from separate
  institutions. Concept-based explanations provided tissue patterns
  interpretable by pathologists.

  **Conclusions\:** These results show that the model finds predictive
  power in the tissue beyond the morphological ISUP grading.

# Introduction

Prostate cancer is a common malignancy among men, affecting 1.4 million
per year.\[1\] A significant proportion of these men will receive the
primary curative treatment of a prostatectomy. This surgery's success
can partly be judged by the concentration of prostate-specific antigen
(PSA) in the blood. While it has a dubious role in prostate cancer
screening\[2,3\], this protein is a valuable biomarker in PCa patients'
follow-up post-prostatectomy. In a successful surgery, the concentration
will mostly be undetectable (\<0.1 ng/mL) after four to six weeks\[4\].

However, in approximately 30% of the patients \[5--7\], PSA will rise
again after surgery, called biochemical recurrence, pointing to regrowth
of prostate cancer cells. Biochemical recurrence is a prognostic
indicator for subsequent progression to clinical metastases and prostate
cancer death.\[8\] Estimating chances of biochemical recurrence could
help to better stratify patients for specific adjuvant treatments.

The risk of biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer is currently
assessed in clinical practice through a combination of the ISUP
grade\[9\], the PSA value at diagnosis and the TNM staging criteria. In
a recent European consensus guideline, these factors were proposed to
separate the patients into a low-risk, intermediate-risk and high-risk
group.\[10\] A high ISUP grade independently can, independently of other
factors, assign a patient to the intermediate (grade 2/3) or high-risk
group (grade 4/5).

Based on the distribution of the Gleason growth patterns\[11\], which
are prognostically predictive morphological patterns of prostate cancer,
pathologists assign cancerous tissue obtained via biopsy or
prostatectomy into one of five groups. They are commonly referred to as
International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade groups, the
ISUP grade, Gleason grade groups, or just grade groups. \[9,12--14\].
Throughout this paper we will use the term ISUP grade. The ISUP grade
suffers from several well-known limitations. For example, there is
substantial disagreement in the grading using the Gleason
scheme.\[15\]\[14\]. Furthermore, although the Gleason growth patterns
have seen significant updates and additions since their inception in the
1960s, they remain relatively coarse descriptors of tissue morphology.
As such, the prognostic potential of more fine-grained morphological
features has been underexplored. We hypothesize that artificial
intelligence, and more specifically deep learning, has the potential to
discover such information and unlock the true prognostic value of
morphological assessment of cancer. Specifically, we developed a deep
learning system (DLS), trained on H&E-stained histopathological tissue
sections, yielding a score for the likelihood of early biochemical
recurrence.

Deep learning is a recent new class of machine learning algorithms that
encompasses models called neural networks. These networks are optimized
using training data; images with labels, such as recurrence information.
From the training data, relevant features to predict the labels are
automatically inferred. During development, the generalization of these
features is tested on separated training data, which is not used for
learning. Afterwards, a third independent set of data, the test set, is
used to ensure generalization. Since features are inferred, handcrafted
feature engineering is not needed anymore to develop machine learning
models. Neural networks are the current state-of-the-art in image
classification\[16\].

Deep learning has previously been shown to find visual patterns to
predict genetic mutations from morphology, for example, in
lymphoma\[17\] and lung cancer\[18\]. Additionally, deep learning has
been used for feature discovery in colorectal cancer\[19\] and
intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma\[20\] using survival data. Although deep
learning has been used with biochemical recurrence data on prostate
cancer, Leo et al.\[21\] assumed manual feature selection beforehand,
strongly limiting the extent of new features to be discovered. Yamamoto
et al.\[22\] used whole slide images and a deep-learning-based encoding
of the slides to tackle the slides' high resolution. They leverage
classical regression techniques and support-vector machine models on
these encodings. The deep learning model was not directly trained on the
outcome, limiting the feature discovery in this work as well.

A common critique of deep learning is its black-box nature of the
inferred features.\[23\] Especially in the medical field, decisions
based on these algorithms should be extensively validated and be
explainable. Besides making the algorithms' prediction trustworthy and
transparent, from a research perspective, it would be beneficial to
visualize the data patterns which the model learned, allowing insight
into the inferred features. We can visualize the patterns learned by the
network leveraging a new technique called Automatic Concept Explanations
(ACE)\[24\]. ACE clusters patches of the input image using their
intermediate inferred features showing common patterns inferred by the
network. We were interested in finding these common concepts over a
range of images to unravel patterns that the model has identified.

This study aimed to use deep learning to develop a new prognostic
biomarker based on tissue morphology for recurrence in patients with
prostate cancer treated by radical prostatectomy. As training data, we
used a nested case-control study\[25\]. This study design ensured we
could evaluate whether the network learned differentiating patterns
independent of Gleason patterns. The prognostic biomarker provides a
strong correlation with biochemical recurrence in two sets (n=182 and
n=204) from separate institutions. Furthermore, the Automatic
Concept-based Explanations provided tissue patterns interpretable by our
pathologist.

# Methods

## Cohorts

Two independent cohorts of patients who underwent prostatectomy for
clinically localized prostate cancer were used in this study. Patients
were treated at either the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore or New
York Langone Medical Center. Both cohorts were accessed via the Prostate
Cancer Biorepository Network\[26\].

For the development of the novel deep-learning-based biomarker (further
referred to as DLS biomarker), we used a nested case-control study of
patients from Johns Hopkins. The Johns Hopkins University School of
Medicine Institutional Review Board provided ethical regulatory approval
for collection and disbursement of data and materials. The study
consists of 524 matched pairs (724 unique patients) containing four
tissue spots per patient. They were sampled from 4,860 prostate cancer
patients with clinically localized prostate cancer who received radical
retropubic prostatectomy between 1993 and 2001. Men were routinely
checked after prostatectomy at 3 months and at least yearly thereafter.
Surveillance for recurrence was conducted using digital rectal
examination and measurement of serum PSA concentration. Patients were
followed for outcome until 2005, with a median follow-up of 4.0 years.
The outcome was defined as recurrence, based on biochemical recurrence
(serum PSA \>0.2 ng/mL on 2 or more occasions after a previously
undetectable level after prostatectomy), or events indicating
biochemical recurrence before this was measured; local recurrence,
systemic metastases, or death from prostate cancer. Controls were paired
to cases with recurrence using incidence density sampling\[27\]. For
each case, a control was selected who had not experienced recurrence by
the date of the case's recurrence and was additionally matched based on
age at surgery, race, pathologic stage, and Gleason sum in the
prostatectomy specimen based on the pathology reports. Given the
incidence density sampling of controls, some men were used as controls
for multiple cases, and some controls developed recurrence later and
became cases for that time period.

The TMA spots were cores (0.6 mm in diameter) from the highest-grade
tumour nodule. Random subsamples were taken in quadruplicate for each
case. The whole slides were scanned using a Hamamatsu NanoZoomer-XR
slide scanner at 0.23 Î¼m/px. TMA core images were extracted using QuPath
(v0.2.3, \[28\]). We discarded analysis of cores with less than 25%
tissue. The cores were manually checked (HP) for prostate cancer,
excluding 535 cores without clear cancer cells present in the TMA
cross-section, resulting in a total of 2343 TMA spots. The nested
case-control set was split based on the matched pairs into a development
set (268 unique pairs), and a test set (91 pairs); the latter was used
for evaluation only. We leveraged cross-validation by subdividing the
development into three folds to tune the models on different parts of
the development set. We divided paired patient, randomly, keeping into
account the distribution of the matched variables. The random assignment
was done using the scikit-multilearn package\[29\], specifically the
'IterativeStratification' method in 'skmultilearn.model_selection'.
After splitting the dataset into training and test, we split the
training dataset into three folds using the same method for the
cross-validation.

To validate the DLS biomarker on a fully independent external set, we
used the cohort from New York Langone Medical Center. The New York
University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board provided
ethical regulatory approval for collection and disbursement of data and
materials. The external validation cohort consists of 204 patients with
localized prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy between
2001 and 2003. Patients were followed for outcome until 2019, with a
median follow-up of 5 years. Biochemical recurrence was defined as
either a single PSA measurement of â¥ 0.4 ng/m or PSA level of â¥ 0.2
ng/ml followed by increasing PSA values in subsequent follow-up. Cores
were sampled from the largest tumour focus or any higher-grade focus (\>
3mm). Subsamples were taken in quadruplicate for each case. Images were
scanned using a Leica Aperio AT2 slide scanner at 0.25 Î¼/px.

## Model details

For developing the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) we used
PyTorch\[30\]. As an architecture, we used ResNet50-D\[31\] pretrained
on ImageNet from PyTorch Image Models\[32\]. We used the Lookahead
optimizer\[33\] with RAdam\[34\], with a learning rate of 2e-4 and
mini-batch size of 16 images. We used weight decay (7e-3), and a
drop-out layer (p=0.15) before the final fully-connected layer. We used
EfficientNet-style\[35\] dropping of residual connections (p=0.3) as
implemented in PyTorch Image Models. We used Bayesian Optimization to
find the optimal values (See Supplementary Notes 1 for details about the
searchspace)

We resized the TMAs to 1.0 mu/pixel spacing and cropped to 768x768
pixels. Extensive data augmentations were used to promote
generalization. The transformations were: flipping, rotations, warping,
random crop, HSV color augmentations, jpeg compression, elastic
transformations, Gaussian blurring, contrast alterations, gamma
alterations, brightness alterations, embossing, sharpening, Gaussian
noise and cutout\[36\]. Augmentations were implemented by
albumentations\[37\] and fast.ai\[38\].

TMA spots from cases experiencing recurrence were assigned a value of
0-4, depending on the year on which the first event, either biochemical
recurrence, metastases, or prostate cancer-related death, was recorded,
with 0 meaning recurrence within a year, 4 meaning after 4+ years. TMA
spots from cases without an event were also assigned the label 4.

We validated the model on the development validation fold each epoch
with a moving average of the weights from 5 subsequent epochs. We used
the concordance index as a metric to decide which model performed the
best.

As the final prediction at the patient level, the TMA spot with the
highest score was used. The final DLS consists of an ensemble of 15
convolutional neural networks. Using cross-validation as described
above, 15 networks were trained for each fold, of which the five best
performing were used for the DLS. See Figure 1 for a graphical overview
of the methods, further details can be found in the Supplementary
Methods.

## Statistics and Reproducibility

For primary analysis of the nested case-control study, odds ratios (OR)
and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using conditional
logistic regression, following Dluzniewski et al.\[39\]. Due to the
study design, calculating hazard ratios using a Cox proportional hazard
regression is not appropriate. For the primary analysis, the continuous
DLS marker was given as the only variable. For a secondary analysis, we
added the non-matched variables PSA, positive surgical margins, and a
binned indicator variable for year of surgery. Since matching was done
on Gleason sum, and our goal was to identify patterns beyond currently
used Gleason patterns, we corrected for the residual differences of the
ISUP grade between cases and control (see Table 1). A correction was
performed by adding a continuous covariate since, due to the small
differences, an indicator covariate did not converge. Analysis was done
using the lifelines Python package (v. 0.25.10)\[40\] with Python (v.
3.7.8). P-values were calculated as a Wald test per single parameter.
Since the DLS predicts the time to recurrence, high values indicate a
low probability of recurrence. We multiplied the DLS output by -1 to
make the analysis more interpretable. For three patients (1 from the
Johns Hopkins cohort and 2 from the New York Langone cohort), PSA values
were missing and were therefore replaced by the median.

For primary analysis of the New York Langone cohort, we calculated
hazard ratios (HR) using a Cox proportional hazards regression. We
report a secondary multivariable analysis including indicator variables
for relevant clinical covariates, Gleason sum, pathological stage, and
surgical margin status. We tested the proportional hazards assumption as
satisfactory (every p-value above 0.01) using the Pearson correlation
between the residuals and the rank of follow-up time. Kaplan Meier plots
were generated for the New York Langone cohort. Due to the nested
case-control design for the Johns Hopkins set, this set could not be
visualized in a Kaplan Meier plot.

## Automatic Concept Explanations

To generate concepts, we picked the best performing single CNN from the
DLS based on its validation set fold. We used a combination of the
methods of Yeh et al., 2020\[41\] and Ghorbani et al., 2019\[24\].

We tiled the TMA images into 256x256 patches within the tissue,
discarding patches with more than 50% whitespace. These patches were
padded to the original input shape of the CNN (768x768 pixels). The
latent space of layer 42 of 50 was saved for each tile. Afterwards, we
used PCA (50 components) to lower the dimensionality and then performed
k-means (k=15) to cluster the latent spaces.

In contrast to Yeh et al. and Ghorbani et al., we did not sort the
concepts on completeness of the explanations or importance for
prediction of individual samples. We sorted the concepts to find
interesting new patterns related to recurrence across images by ranking
the concepts based on the DLS score of the TMA spot from which they
originated.

For each concept, 25 examples were randomly picked and visually
inspected by a pathologist (JvI), with a special interest in
uropathology, blinded to the case characteristics and prediction of the
network.

# Results

The DLS system was developed on the Johns Hopkins cohort with 2343 TMA
spots of 685 included unique patients (39 patients were excluded due to
insufficient tumour amount in the cores). 492 patients were recurrence
cases (72%). The 685 included patients were split into a development set
of 503 unique patients and a test set of 91 matched pairs of cases and
controls (182 unique patients).

In the external validation cohort, 38 out of the 204 patients (19%) had
biochemical recurrence after complete remission, PSA nadir after 3
months post-prostatectomy. From the 204 patients, 620 TMA spots were
included. Clinical characteristics of the cohorts can be found in Table
1 and Table 2.

The DLS marker showed a strong association in the primary analyses on
the test set of the Johns Hopkins cohort with an OR of recurrence of
3.28 (95% CI 1.73-6.23; p\<0.005) per unit increase, with DLS system
continuous output ranging from 0-3, with two cases below 0 (-0.27 and
-0.24) (Table 3).

In addition, for the John Hopkins cohort, we checked for confounding by
ISUP grade, PSA level at diagnosis, positive surgical margins, and year
of prostatectomy. Neither covariate was found to bias the estimates of
effect substantially. The biomarker maintained a strong correlation of
OR 3.32 (CI 1.63 - 6.77; p=0.001) per unit increase, adjusting for these
factors and the continuous term for the residual difference between
cases and controls in the ISUP grade.

In the univariable analysis, the DLS marker was strongly associated with
recurrence in the New York Langone external validation cohort with an HR
of 5.78 (95% CI 2.44-13.72; p\<0.005) per unit increase. In the
multivariate model, including ISUP grade and the other prognostic
indicators in addition to the DLS biomarker, the DLS biomarker was still
strongly associated with recurrence with an HR of 3.02 (CI 1.10 - 8.29;
p=0.03) per unit increase (Table 4). Kaplan Meier curves based on a
median cut-off, and four-group categorization, show a clear separation
of the low-risk and high-risk groups (Figure 2).

Automatic Concept Explanations provided semantically meaningful concepts
(Figure 3). Concepts were identified that correlated with either a
relatively rapid or slow biochemical recurrence. Visual inspection by
JvI reveals that generally, the concepts with adverse behaviour show
mainly Gleason pattern 4 and some Gleason pattern 5, with cribriform
configuration in TMAs within the concepts with most adverse behaviour.
The two intermediate concepts show mainly stroma and less aggressive
growth patterns. The two concepts predicted to be part of late
recurrence cases show mainly Gleason 3 patterns, with readily
recognizable well-formed glands. See the Supplementary Notes 2 for a
detailed analysis.

# Discussion

We have developed a deep-learning-based morphological biomarker for the
prediction of prostate cancer biochemical recurrence based on
prostatectomy tissue microarrays. Using a nested case-control study, we
trained convolutional neural networks end-to-end with biochemical
recurrence data. The DLS marker provides a continuous score based on the
speed of biochemical recurrence it perceived. The DLS marker had an OR
of 3.32 (CI 1.63 - 6.77; p=0.001) per unit increase for the test set,
and an HR of 3.02 (CI 1.10 - 8.29; p=0.03) per unit increase for the
external validation set. These findings support our hypothesis that
there is more morphological information in the tissue besides the ISUP
grade.

In the Kaplan Meier plot (Figure 2) the biomarker especially seems able
to separate men with relatively rapid recurrence from men without (\<5
years). However, we hypothesize that the decreased long-term separation
in those survival curves is less due to the training cohort containing a
median follow-up for four years. Furthermore, we choose to group
patients together with more than four years of no biochemical
recurrence, This limits the model\'s capabilities to differentiate
patients with very late recurrence. Additionally, due to the limitations
of the morphology of the present tumour to inform about long-term
outcomes (e.g., cells that escaped the primary tumour may subsequently
acquire genomic changes that influence recurrence). Furthermore, it
should be noted that the number of at-risk patients was small at these
long-term time points.

The nested case-control study contained follow-up information in
timespans of years, this limited the use of survival based loss
functions\[42\]. When more granular follow-up information is at hand,
future work could investigate usage of Cox regression based loss
functions to better leverage the information of the clinical cohort.

The DLS marker showed strong and similar association in both cohorts
prepared at different pathology laboratories, which supports the
robustness to differences in tissue preparation, staining protocols and
scanners.

We showed that Automatic Concept Explanation may be helpful to find
concepts correlated with good and poor prognosis. The most
discriminatory concepts followed the morphological patterns of Gleason
grading. Well-defined prostate cancer glands were predicted to undergo
biochemical recurrence later than disorganized sheets of prostate cancer
cells. These concepts support the DLS system capturing the expected
morphological patterns in support of the validity of the DLS approach.

This study focused on the use of deep learning to automatically discover
features relevant for biochemical recurrence prediction. Compared to
before-mentioned studies on prostate cancer prognostics models\[21,22\],
we are the first paper to directly optimize a neural network from
prostatectomy tissue towards biochemical recurrence. Additionally, we
report that training towards the biochemical recurrence endpoint results
in patterns in the networks' features aligning with the ISUP grading.

In the increasing digitalisation of pathology labs, our DLS marker may
be applied on digitally chosen regions of interest. Our marker is
trained on tissue microarray spots that were selected at the highest
grade cancer focus. Furthermore, it has to be noted that a TMA core
allows for only limited assessment of the overall prostate cancer growth
patterns. Since these tissue cores represent only limited samples from
what is usually a much larger tumour lesion, the potential more
aggressive patterns may still be present outside of the chosen regions,
including regions of potential extraprostatic extension and perineural
invasion. Validation will need to be done on entire prostatectomy
sections and across cancer foci.

There have been improvements to prostate cancer grading\[11,13\], and
recently the cribriform pattern is suggested to be important for
prognostics\[14,43\]. However, the evaluation of this pattern can show a
range of inter-observer variability\[44\], although a recent consensus
approach could help decrease this variability\[45\]. Although we
certainly have to keep in mind all the before-mentioned limitations, our
findings are in line with outcomes concerning adverse behaviour in
earlier work. The DLS system identified a concept that consisted of
fields with cribriform-like growth patterns. This cribriform-like growth
pattern was found to be part of the concept that was most associated
with early recurrent cases.

The results in this study are limited to newer insights of prostate
cancer growth, information on cribriform-growth and intraductal
carcinoma were not readily available for use in the multivariate
analysis, although the external validation cohort was graded using the
2005 ISUP consensus \[46\] partly encoding the presence of cribriform
growth inside the ISUP grade.

Although biochemical recurrence is a common end-point to study prostate
cancer progression, a clinical utility would be mostly found in
assessing time-to-metastases or death. However, time-wise, they are
typically significantly further separated from the surgical event,
making it harder to identify relationships between tissue morphology and
these end-points. Nevertheless, we would like to investigate them in the
future.

# Conclusions

In summary, we have developed a deep-learning-based visual biomarker for
prostate cancer recurrence based on tissue microarray hotspots of
prostatectomies. The DLS marker provides a continuous score predicting
the speed of biochemical recurrence. We obtained an odds ratio of 3.32
(CI 1.63 - 6.77; p=0.001) for a nested case-control study from Johns
Hopkins Hospital, matched on Gleason sum on other factors. Additionally,
we obtained an HR of 3.02 (CI 1.10 - 8.29; p=0.03) for an external
validation cohort from the New York Langone hospital, adjusted for ISUP
grade, pathological stage, preoperative PSA concentration, and surgical
margins status. Thus, this visual biomarker may provide prognostic
information in addition to the current morphological ISUP grade.

**Figure 1.**

**Title:** Overview of the methods summarizing the biomarker development
and the Automatic Concept Explanations (ACE) process.

**Legend:** Cores were extracted from TMA slides and used to train a
neural network to predict the years to biochemical recurrence. On the
nested case-control test set, a matched analysis was performed. For ACE,
patches were generated from the cores, inferenced through the network
and clustered based on their intermediate features.

**Title:** Kaplan Meier plot for New York Langone external validation
cohort,

**Legend:** Groups were separated using the median DLS biomarker score
in this cohort (a) and using four thresholds (b).

**Figure 3.\
Title:** Examples of Automatic Concepts Explanations.

**Legend:** Concepts were sorted by their average score for the cores in
which the pattern occurs. Showing the two most benign concepts, two
intermediate and two aggressive concepts. The boxes show the quartiles
of the concept predictions while the whiskers extend to show the rest of
the distribution except for outlier points that lie below the 25% or
above 75% of the data, by 1.5 times the interquartile range. Green,
yellow and red shaded areas indicate 33%, 66% percentiles. See the
Supplementary Notes 2 for all concepts.
