Continuous effort has been made at finding effective strategies to interpret these types of models, among them saliency maps, which depict the weights of the pixels on the classification as an heatmap of intensity values, have been by far the most used for image classification. However, there is a lack of tools for the systematic evaluation of saliency maps, and existing works introduce non-natural noise such as random or uniform values. To address this issue, we propose an approach to evaluate the faithfulness of the saliency maps by introducing natural perturbations in the image, based on oppose-class substitution, and studying their impact on evaluation metrics adapted from saliency models. We validate the proposed approach on a breast cancer metastases detection dataset PatchCamelyon with 327,680 patches of histopathological images of sentinel lymph node sections. Results show that GradCAM, Guided-GradCAM and gradient-based saliency map methods are sensitive to natural perturbations and correlate to the presence of tumor evidence in the image. Overall, this approach proves to be a solution for the validation of saliency map methods without introducing confounding variables and shows potential for application on other medical imaging tasks.},

The presence, frequency, location, tissue type, and the clinical impacts of missing tissue were assessed. Scanning time, type of the specimens, time to WSIs implementation, and quality control (QC) measures were also considered. The frequency of missing tissue ranged from 2\% to 19\%. The area size of the missed tissue ranged from 1\textendash 70\%. In most cases ({$>$}75\%), the missing tissue area size was {$<$}10\% and peripherally located. In all cases the missed tissue was fat with or without small entrapped normal breast parenchyma. No missing tissue was identified in WSIs of the core biopsy specimens. QC measures improved images quality and reduced WSI failure rates by seven-fold. A negative linear correlation between the frequency of missing tissue and both the scanning time and the image file size was observed (               p               \,{$<$}\,0.05). None of the WSI with missing tissues resulted in a change in the final diagnosis. Missing tissue on breast WSI is observed but with variable frequency and little diagnostic consequence. Balancing between WSI quality and scanning time/image file size should be considered and pathology laboratories should undertake their own assessments of risk and provide the relevant mitigations with the appropriate level of caution.},

Studies in recent years have demonstrated that leveraging information from complementary multimodal data can improve prognostication, further illustrating the potential utility of such methods. Model interpretation is crucial for facilitating the clinical adoption of deep learning methods by fostering practitioner understanding and trust in the technology. However, while prior works have presented novel multimodal neural network architectures as means to improve prognostication performance, these approaches: 1) do not comprehensively leverage biological and histomorphological relationships and 2) make use of emerging strategies to ``pretrain'' models (i.e., train models on a slightly orthogonal dataset/modeling objective) which may aid prognostication by reducing the amount of information required for achieving optimal performance. Here, we develop an interpretable multimodal modeling framework that combines DNA methylation, gene expression, and histopathology (i.e., tissue slides) data, and we compare the performances of crossmodal pretraining, contrastive learning, and transfer learning versus the standard procedure in this context. Our models outperform the existing state-of-the-art method (average 11.54\% C-index increase), and baseline clinically driven models. Our results demonstrate that the selection of pretraining strategies is crucial for obtaining highly accurate prognostication models, even more so than devising an innovative model architecture, and further emphasize the all-important role of the tumor microenvironment on disease progression.},

  abstract = {Robust cancer prognostication can enable more effective patient care and management, which may potentially improve health outcomes. Deep learning has proven to be a powerful tool to extract meaningful information from cancer patient data. In recent years it has displayed promise in quantifying prognostication by predicting patient risk. However, most current deep learning-based cancer prognosis prediction methods use only a single data source and miss out on learning from potentially rich relationships across modalities. Existing multimodal approaches are challenging to interpret in a biological or medical context, limiting real-world clinical integration as a trustworthy prognostic decision aid. Here, we developed a multimodal modeling approach that can integrate information from the central modalities of gene expression, DNA methylation, and histopathological imaging with clinical information for cancer prognosis prediction. Our multimodal modeling approach combines pathway and gene-based sparsely coded layers with patch-based graph convolutional networks to facilitate biological interpretation of the model results. We present a preliminary analysis that compares the potential applicability of combining all modalities to uni- or bi-modal approaches. Leveraging data from four cancer subtypes from the Cancer Genome Atlas, results demonstrate the encouraging performance of our multimodal approach (C-index=0.660 without clinical features; C-index=0.665 with clinical features) across four cancer subtypes versus unimodal approaches and existing state-of-the-art approaches. This work brings insight to the development of interpretable multimodal methods of applying AI to biomedical data and can potentially serve as a foundation for clinical implementations of such software. We plan to follow up this preliminary analysis with an in-depth exploration of factors to improve multimodal modeling approaches on an in-house dataset.},

Unsupervised domain adaptation based on image-to-image translation is gaining importance in this field by addressing variabilities without the manual overhead. Here, we tackle the variation of different histological stains by unsupervised stain-to-stain translation to enable a stain-independent applicability of a deep learning segmentation model. Methods We use CycleGANs for stain-to-stain translation in kidney histopathology, and propose two novel approaches to improve translational effectivity. First, we integrate a prior segmentation network into the CycleGAN for a self-supervised, application-oriented optimization of translation through semantic guidance, and second, we incorporate extra channels to the translation output to implicitly separate artificial meta-information otherwise encoded for tackling underdetermined reconstructions. Results The latter showed partially superior performances to the unmodified CycleGAN, but the former performed best in all stains providing instance-level Dice scores ranging between 78\% and 92\% for most kidney structures, such as glomeruli, tubules, and veins. However, CycleGANs showed only limited performance in the translation of other structures, e.g. arteries. Our study also found somewhat lower performance for all structures in all stains when compared to segmentation in the original stain. Conclusions Our study suggests that with current unsupervised technologies, it seems unlikely to produce ``generally'' applicable simulated stains.},

Since tackling all sources of stain variability with manual annotation is not feasible, we here investigated and compared unsupervised DL approaches to reduce the consequences of stain variability in kidney pathology. Methods We aimed to improve the applicability of a pretrained DL segmentation model to 3 external multi-centric cohorts with large stain variability. In contrast to the traditional approach of training generative adversarial networks (GAN) for stain normalization, we here propose to tackle stain variability by data augmentation. We augment the training data of the pretrained model by the stain variability using CycleGANs and then retrain the model on the stain-augmented dataset. We compared the performance of i/ the unmodified pretrained segmentation model with ii/ CycleGAN-based stain normalization, iii/ a feature-preserving modification to ii/ for improved normalization, and iv/ the proposed stain-augmented model. Results The proposed stain-augmented model showed highest mean segmentation accuracy in all external cohorts and maintained comparable performance on the training cohort. However, the increase in performance was only marginal compared to the pretrained model. CycleGAN-based stain normalization suffered from encoded imperceptible information into the normalizations that confused the pretrained model and thus resulted in slightly worse performance. Conclusions Our findings suggest that stain variability can be tackled more effectively by augmenting data by it than by following the commonly used approach of normalizing the stain. However, the applicability of this approach providing only a rather slight performance increase has to be weighted against an additional carbon footprint.},

  abstract = {Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, with lung adenocarcinoma being the most prevalent form of lung cancer. EGFR positive lung adenocarcinomas have been shown to have high response rates to TKI therapy, underlying the essential nature of molecular testing for lung cancers. Despite current guidelines consider testing necessary, a large portion of patients are not routinely profiled, resulting in millions of people not receiving the optimal treatment for their lung cancer. Sequencing is the gold standard for molecular testing of EGFR mutations, but it can take several weeks for results to come back, which is not ideal in a time constrained scenario. The development of alternative screening tools capable of detecting EGFR mutations quickly and cheaply while preserving tissue for sequencing could help reduce the amount of sub-optimally treated patients. We propose a multi-modal approach which integrates pathology images and clinical variables to predict EGFR mutational status achieving an AUC of 84\% on the largest clinical cohort to date. Such a computational model could be deployed at large at little additional cost. Its clinical application could reduce the number of patients who receive sub-optimal treatments by 53.1\% in China, and up to 96.6\% in the US.},

  abstract = {Multimodal models trained on large natural image-text pair datasets have exhibited astounding abilities in generating high-quality images. Medical imaging data is fundamentally different to natural images, and the language used to succinctly capture relevant details in medical data uses a different, narrow but semantically rich, domain-specific vocabulary. Not surprisingly, multi-modal models trained on natural image-text pairs do not tend to generalize well to the medical domain. Developing generative imaging models faithfully representing medical concepts while providing compositional diversity could mitigate the existing paucity of high-quality, annotated medical imaging datasets. In this work, we develop a strategy to overcome the large natural-medical distributional shift by adapting a pre-trained latent diffusion model on a corpus of publicly available chest x-rays (CXR) and their corresponding radiology (text) reports. We investigate the model's ability to generate high-fidelity, diverse synthetic CXR conditioned on text prompts. We assess the model outputs quantitatively using image quality metrics, and evaluate image quality and text-image alignment by human domain experts. We present evidence that the resulting model (RoentGen) is able to create visually convincing, diverse synthetic CXR images, and that the output can be controlled to a new extent by using free-form text prompts including radiology-specific language. Fine-tuning this model on a fixed training set and using it as a data augmentation method, we measure a 5\% improvement of a classifier trained jointly on synthetic and real images, and a 3\% improvement when trained on a larger but purely synthetic training set. Finally, we observe that this fine-tuning distills in-domain knowledge in the text-encoder and can improve its representation capabilities of certain diseases like pneumothorax by 25\%.},

Recent work has shown how the step size can itself be optimized alongside the model parameters by manually deriving expressions for "hypergradients" ahead of time. We show how to *automatically* compute hypergradients with a simple and elegant modification to backpropagation. This allows us to easily apply the method to other optimizers and hyperparameters (e.g. momentum coefficients). We can even recursively apply the method to its own *hyper*-hyperparameters, and so on ad infinitum. As these towers of optimizers grow taller, they become less sensitive to the initial choice of hyperparameters. We present experiments validating this for MLPs, CNNs, and RNNs. Finally, we provide a simple PyTorch implementation of this algorithm (see http://people.csail.mit.edu/kach/gradient-descent-the-ultimate-optimizer).},

Stain color variations indicate the slides exhibit greatly different color appearance due to the diversity of chemical stains, staining procedures, and slide scanners. Previous approaches tend to improve model robustness via data augmentation or stain color normalization. However, they still suffer from generalization to new domains with unseen stain colors. In this study, we address the issue of unseen color domain generalization in histopathology images by encouraging the model to adapt varied stain colors. To this end, we propose a novel data augmentation method, stain mixup, which incorporates the stain colors of unseen domains into training data. Unlike previous mix-up methods employed in computer vision, the proposed method constructs the combination of stain colors without using any label information, hence enabling unsupervised domain generalization. Extensive experiments are conducted and demonstrate that our method is general enough to different tasks and stain methods, including H\&E stains for tumor classification and hematological stains for bone marrow cell instance segmentation. The results validate that the proposed stain mix-up can significantly improves the performance on the unseen domains.},

Computationally identifying WSIs with similar morphologic features within large repositories without requiring supervised training can have significant applications. However, the retrieval speeds of algorithms for searching similar WSIs often scale with the repository size, which limits their clinical and research potential. Here we show that self-supervised deep learning can be leveraged to search for and retrieve WSIs at speeds that are independent of repository size. The algorithm, which we named SISH (for self-supervised image search for histology) and provide as an open-source package, requires only slide-level annotations for training, encodes WSIs into meaningful discrete latent representations and leverages a tree data structure for fast searching followed by an uncertainty-based ranking algorithm for WSI retrieval. We evaluated SISH on multiple tasks (including retrieval tasks based on tissue-patch queries) and on datasets spanning over 22,000 patient cases and 56 disease subtypes. SISH can also be used to aid the diagnosis of rare cancer types for which the number of available WSIs is often insufficient to train supervised deep-learning models.},

  abstract = {Knowledge distillation aims to compress a powerful yet cumbersome teacher model into a lightweight student model without much sacrifice of performance. For this purpose, various approaches have been proposed over the past few years, generally with elaborately designed knowledge representations, which in turn increase the difficulty of model development and interpretation. In contrast, we empirically show that a simple knowledge distillation technique is enough to significantly narrow down the teacher-student performance gap. We directly reuse the discriminative classifier from the pre-trained teacher model for student inference and train a student encoder through feature alignment with a single \$\textbackslash ell\_2\$ loss. In this way, the student model is able to achieve exactly the same performance as the teacher model provided that their extracted features are perfectly aligned. An additional projector is developed to help the student encoder match with the teacher classifier, which renders our technique applicable to various teacher and student architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our technique achieves state-of-the-art results at the modest cost of compression ratio due to the added projector.},

  abstract = {Vision Transformers (ViTs) and their multi-scale and hierarchical variations have been successful at capturing image representations but their use has been generally studied for low-resolution images (e.g. 256 \texttimes{} 256, 384 \texttimes{} 384). For gigapixel whole-slide imaging (WSI) in computational pathology, WSIs can be as large as 150000 \texttimes{} 150000 pixels at 20\texttimes{} magnification and exhibit a hierarchical structure of visual tokens across varying resolutions: from 16 \texttimes{} 16 images capturing individual cells, to 4096\texttimes 4096 images characterizing interactions within the tissue microenvironment. We introduce a new ViT architecture called the Hierarchical Image Pyramid Transformer (HIPT), which leverages the natural hierarchical structure inherent in WSIs using two levels of self-supervised learning to learn high-resolution image representations. HIPT is pretrained across 33 cancer types using 10,678 gigapixel WSIs, 408,218 4096\texttimes 4096 images, and 104M 256 \texttimes{} 256 images. We benchmark HIPT representations on 9 slide-level tasks, and demonstrate that: 1) HIPT with hierarchical pretraining outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for cancer subtyping and survival prediction, 2) self-supervised ViTs are able to model important inductive biases about the hierarchical structure of phenotypes in the tumor microenvironment.},

  abstract = {Whole slide images (WSIs) are digitized histopathology images. WSIs are stored in a pyramidal data structure that contains the same images at multiple magnification levels. In digital pathology, most algorithmic approaches to analyze WSIs use a single magnification level. However, images at different magnification levels may reveal relevant and distinct properties in the image, such as global context or detailed spatial arrangement. Given their high resolution, WSIs cannot be processed as a whole and are broken down into smaller pieces called tiles. Then, a prediction at the tile-level is made for each tile in the larger image. As many classification problems require a prediction at a slide-level, there exist common strategies to integrate the tile-level insights into a slide-level prediction. We explore two approaches to tackle this problem, namely a multiple instance learning framework and a representation learning algorithm (the so-called ``barcode approach'') based on clustering. In this work, we apply both approaches in a single- and multi-scale setting and compare the results in a multi-label histopathology classification task to show the promises and pitfalls of multi-scale analysis. Our work shows a consistent improvement in performance of the multi-scale models over single-scale ones. Using multiple instance learning and the barcode approach we achieved a 0.06 and 0.06 improvement in F1 score, respectively, highlighting the importance of combining multiple scales to integrate contextual and detailed information.},

Our method leverages {$>$}1.6 million annotations from board-certified pathologists across {$>$}5700 samples to train deep learning models for cell and tissue classification that can exhaustively map whole-slide images at two and four micron-resolution. Cell- and tissue-type model outputs are combined into 607 HIFs that quantify specific and biologically-relevant characteristics across five cancer types. We demonstrate that these HIFs correlate with well-known markers of the tumor microenvironment and can predict diverse molecular signatures (AUROC 0.601\textendash 0.864), including expression of four immune checkpoint proteins and homologous recombination deficiency, with performance comparable to `black-box' methods. Our HIF-based approach provides a comprehensive, quantitative, and interpretable window into the composition and spatial architecture of the tumor microenvironment.},

This allows us to train on gigapixel images using only slide-level labels without resorting to patches or decoupled network training strategies.

We achieve a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.9757 for metastatic breast cancer detection (CAMELYON16), which is close to fully supervised approaches that use pixel-level annotations.

  abstract = {Following tremendous success in natural language processing, transformers have recently shown much promise for computer vision. The self-attention operation underlying transformers yields global interactions between all tokens, i.e. words or image patches, and enables flexible modelling of image data beyond the local interactions of convolutions. This flexibility, however, comes with a quadratic complexity in time and memory, hindering application to long sequences and high-resolution images. We propose a ``transposed'' version of self-attention that operates across feature channels rather than tokens, where the interactions are based on the cross-covariance matrix between keys and queries. The resulting cross-covariance attention (XCA) has linear complexity in the number of tokens, and allows efficient processing of high-resolution images. Our cross-covariance image transformer (XCiT) \textendash{} built upon XCA \textendash{} combines the accuracy of conventional transformers with the scalability of convolutional architectures. We validate the effectiveness and generality of XCiT by reporting excellent results on multiple vision benchmarks, including (self-supervised) image classification on ImageNet-1k, object detection and instance segmentation on COCO, and semantic segmentation on ADE20k.},

Experiments reveal that our multi-layer combination of many models offers better use of allocated training time than seeking out the best. A second contribution is an extensive evaluation of public and commercial AutoML platforms including TPOT, H2O, AutoWEKA, auto-sklearn, AutoGluon, and Google AutoML Tables. Tests on a suite of 50 classification and regression tasks from Kaggle and the OpenML AutoML Benchmark reveal that AutoGluon is faster, more robust, and much more accurate.

  abstract = {Histopathological Whole Slide Images (WSIs) at giga-pixel resolution are the gold standard for cancer analysis and prognosis. Due to the scarcity of pixel- or patch-level annotations of WSIs, many existing methods attempt to predict survival outcomes based on a three-stage strategy that includes patch selection, patch-level feature extraction and aggregation. However, the patch features are usually extracted by using truncated models (e.g. ResNet) pretrained on ImageNet without fine-tuning on WSI tasks, and the aggregation stage does not consider the many-to-one relationship between multiple WSIs and the patient. In this paper, we propose a novel survival prediction framework that consists of patch sampling, feature extraction and patient-level survival prediction. Specifically, we employ two kinds of self-supervised learning methods, i.e. colorization and cross-channel, as pretext tasks to train convnet-based models that are tailored for extracting features from WSIs. Then, at the patient-level survival prediction we explicitly aggregate features from multiple WSIs, using consistency and contrastive losses to normalize slide-level features at the patient level. We conduct extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets: TCGA-GBM, TCGA-LUSC and NLST. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, as it achieves state-of-the-art performance in comparison with previous studies, with concordance index of 0.670, 0.679 and 0.711 on TCGA-GBM, TCGA-LUSC and NLST, respectively.},

Remarkably, we find that drawing multiple samples per image consistently enhances the test accuracy achieved for both small and large batch training, despite reducing the number of unique training examples in each mini-batch. This benefit arises even when different augmentation multiplicities perform the same number of parameter updates and gradient evaluations. Our results suggest that, although the variance in the gradient estimate arising from subsampling the dataset has an implicit regularization benefit, the variance which arises from the data augmentation process harms test accuracy. By applying augmentation multiplicity to the recently proposed NFNet model family, we achieve a new ImageNet state of the art of 86.8\% top-1 w/o extra data.},

On a challenging genomics OOD detection benchmark, we improve the AUROC from 66\% to 77\% using transformers and unsupervised pre-training. To further improve performance, we explore the few-shot outlier exposure setting where a few examples from outlier classes may be available; we show that pre-trained transformers are particularly well-suited for outlier exposure, and that the AUROC of OOD detection on CIFAR-100 vs CIFAR10 can be improved to 98.7\% with just 1 image per OOD class, and 99.46\% with 10 images per OOD class.

In the absence of labeled data for a certain task, domain adaptation often provides an attractive option given that labeled data of similar nature but from a different domain (e.g. synthetic images) are available. Here, we propose a new approach to domain adaptation in deep architectures that can be trained on large amount of labeled data from the source domain and large amount of unlabeled data from the target domain (no labeled target-domain data is necessary). As the training progresses, the approach promotes the emergence of "deep" features that are (i) discriminative for the main learning task on the source domain and (ii) invariant with respect to the shift between the domains. We show that this adaptation behaviour can be achieved in almost any feed-forward model by augmenting it with few standard layers and a simple new gradient reversal layer. The resulting augmented architecture can be trained using standard backpropagation. Overall, the approach can be implemented with little effort using any of the deep-learning packages. The method performs very well in a series of image classification experiments, achieving adaptation effect in the presence of big domain shifts and outperforming previous state-of-the-art on Office datasets.},

  abstract = {The recent surge in performance for image analysis of digitised pathology slides can largely be attributed to the advances in deep learning. Deep models can be used to initially localise various structures in the tissue and hence facilitate the extraction of interpretable features for biomarker discovery. However, these models are typically trained for a single task and therefore scale poorly as we wish to adapt the model for an increasing number of different tasks. Also, supervised deep learning models are very data hungry and therefore rely on large amounts of training data to perform well. In this paper, we present a multi-task learning approach for segmentation and classification of nuclei, glands, lumina and different tissue regions that leverages data from multiple independent data sources. While ensuring that our tasks are aligned by the same tissue type and resolution, we enable meaningful simultaneous prediction with a single network. As a result of feature sharing, we also show that the learned representation can be used to improve the performance of additional tasks via transfer learning, including nuclear classification and signet ring cell detection. As part of this work, we train our developed Cerberus model on a huge amount of data, consisting of over 600K objects for segmentation and 440K patches for classification. We use our approach to process 599 colorectal whole-slide images from TCGA, where we localise 377 million, 900K and 2.1 million nuclei, glands and lumina, respectively and make the results available to the community for downstream analysis.},

  abstract = {While originally designed for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, the self-attention mechanism has recently taken various computer vision areas by storm. However, the 2D nature of images brings three challenges for applying self-attention in computer vision. (1) Treating images as 1D sequences neglects their 2D structures. (2) The quadratic complexity is too expensive for high-resolution images. (3) It only captures spatial adaptability but ignores channel adaptability. In this paper, we propose a novel large kernel attention (LKA) module to enable self-adaptive and long-range correlations in self-attention while avoiding the above issues. We further introduce a novel neural network based on LKA, namely Visual Attention Network (VAN). While extremely simple and efficient, VAN outperforms the state-of-the-art vision transformers and convolutional neural networks with a large margin in extensive experiments, including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, etc. Code is available at https://github.com/Visual-Attention-Network.},

Using neural networks, we predict senescence from the nuclear morphology of human fibroblasts with up to 95\% accuracy, and investigate murine astrocytes, murine neurons, and fibroblasts with premature aging in culture. After generalizing our approach, the predictor recognizes higher rates of senescence in p21-positive and ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU)-negative nuclei in tissues and shows an increasing rate of senescent cells with age in H\&E-stained murine liver tissue and human dermal biopsies. Evaluating medical records reveals that higher rates of senescent cells correspond to decreased rates of malignant neoplasms and increased rates of osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, hypertension and cerebral infarction. In sum, we show that morphological alterations of the nucleus can serve as a deep learning predictor of senescence that is applicable across tissues and species and is associated with health outcomes in humans.},

  abstract = {This paper shows that masked autoencoders (MAE) are scalable self-supervised learners for computer vision. Our MAE approach is simple: we mask random patches of the input image and reconstruct the missing pixels. It is based on two core designs. First, we develop an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture, with an encoder that operates only on the visible subset of patches (without mask tokens), along with a lightweight decoder that reconstructs the original image from the latent representation and mask tokens. Second, we find that masking a high proportion of the input image, e.g., 75\%, yields a nontrivial and meaningful self-supervisory task. Coupling these two designs enables us to train large models efficiently and effectively: we accelerate training (by 3x or more) and improve accuracy. Our scalable approach allows for learning high-capacity models that generalize well: e.g., a vanilla ViT-Huge model achieves the best accuracy (87.8\%) among methods that use only ImageNet-1K data. Transfer performance in downstream tasks outperforms supervised pre-training and shows promising scaling behavior.},

The Forward-Forward algorithm replaces the forward and backward passes of backpropagation by two forward passes, one with positive (i.e. real) data and the other with negative data which could be generated by the network itself. Each layer has its own objective function which is simply to have high goodness for positive data and low goodness for negative data. The sum of the squared activities in a layer can be used as the goodness but there are many other possibilities, including minus the sum of the squared activities. If the positive and negative passes can be separated in time, the negative passes can be done offline, which makes the learning much simpler in the positive pass and allows video to be pipelined through the network without ever storing activities or stopping to propagate derivatives.},

  abstract = {Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of cancerrelated death in men worldwide. Like many cancers, diagnosis involves expert integration of heterogeneous patient information such as imaging, clinical risk factors, and more. For this reason, there have been many recent efforts toward deep multimodal fusion of image and non-image data for clinical decision tasks. Many of these studies propose methods to fuse learned features from each patient modality, providing significant downstream improvements with techniques like cross-modal attention gating, Kronecker product fusion, orthogonality regularization, and more. While these enhanced fusion operations can improve upon feature concatenation, they often come with an extremely high learning capacity, meaning they are likely to overfit when applied even to small or low-dimensional datasets. Rather than designing a highly expressive fusion operation, we propose three simple methods for improved multimodal fusion with small datasets that aid optimization by generating auxiliary sources of supervision during training: extra supervision, clinical prediction, and dense fusion. We validate the proposed approaches on prostate cancer diagnosis from paired histopathology imaging and tabular clinical features. The proposed methods are straightforward to implement and can be applied to any classification task with paired image and non-image data.},

Such methods are trained on a paired dataset, where an image from the source domain already has a corresponding translated image in the target domain. However, this paired dataset requirement imposes a huge practical constraint, requires domain knowledge or is even impossible to obtain in certain cases. Due to these problems, unsupervised image-to-image translation has been proposed, which does not require domain expertise and can take advantage of a large unlabeled dataset. Although such models perform well, they are hard to train due to the major constraints induced in their loss functions, which make training unstable. Since CycleGAN has been released, numerous methods have been proposed which try to address various problems from different perspectives. In this review, we firstly describe the general image-to-image translation framework and discuss the datasets and metrics involved in the topic. Furthermore, we revise the current state-of-the-art with a classification of existing works. This part is followed by a small quantitative evaluation, for which results were taken from papers.},

  abstract = {In practice, digital pathology images are often affected by various factors, resulting in very large differences in color and brightness. Stain normalization can effectively reduce the differences in color and brightness of digital pathology images, thus improving the performance of computer-aided diagnostic systems. Conventional stain normalization methods rely on one or several reference images, but one or several images are difficult to represent the entire dataset. Although learning-based stain normalization methods are a general approach, they use complex deep networks, which not only greatly reduce computational efficiency, but also risk introducing artifacts. StainNet is a fast and robust stain normalization network, but it has not a sufficient capability for complex stain normalization due to its too simple network structure. In this study, we proposed a parameter-variable stain normalization network, ParamNet. ParamNet contains a parameter prediction sub-network and a color mapping sub-network, where the parameter prediction sub-network can automatically determine the appropriate parameters for the color mapping sub-network according to each input image. The feature of parameter variable ensures that our network has a sufficient capability for various stain normalization tasks. The color mapping sub-network is a fully 1x1 convolutional network with a total of 59 variable parameters, which allows our network to be extremely computationally efficient and does not introduce artifacts. The results on cytopathology and histopathology datasets show that our ParamNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods and can effectively improve the generalization of classifiers on pathology diagnosis tasks.

  abstract = {A serious problem in image classification is that a trained model might perform well for input data that originates from the same distribution as the data available for model training, but performs much worse for out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. In real-world safety-critical applications, in particular, it is important to be aware if a new data point is OOD. To date, OOD detection is typically addressed using either confidence scores, autoencoder based reconstruction, or contrastive learning. However, the global image context has not yet been explored to discriminate the non-local objectness between in-distribution and OOD samples. This paper proposes a first-of-its-kind OOD detection architecture named OODformer that leverages the contextualization capabilities of the transformer. Incorporating the transformer as the principal feature extractor allows us to exploit the object concepts and their discriminatory attributes along with their co-occurrence via visual attention. Based on contextualised embedding, we demonstrate OOD detection using both class-conditioned latent space similarity and a network confidence score. Our approach shows improved generalizability across various datasets. We have achieved a new state-of-the-art result on CIFAR-10/-100 and ImageNet30.

Unfortunately, due to the stochastic nature of diffusion models, it is often difficult to maintain the original content of the image during the reverse diffusion. To address this, here we present a novel diffusion-based unsupervised image translation method using disentangled style and content representation. Specifically, inspired by the splicing Vision Transformer, we extract intermediate keys of multihead self attention layer from ViT model and used them as the content preservation loss. Then, an image guided style transfer is performed by matching the [CLS] classification token from the denoised samples and target image, whereas additional CLIP loss is used for the text-driven style transfer. To further accelerate the semantic change during the reverse diffusion, we also propose a novel semantic divergence loss and resampling strategy. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in both text-guided and image-guided translation tasks.},

Machine-learning models are trained with images from a limited set of domains, and are expected to generalize to images from unseen domains. Methodological design choices have to be made in order to yield domain invariance and proper generalization. In digital pathology, standard approaches focus either on ad-hoc normalization of the latent parameters based on prior knowledge, such as staining normalization, or aim at anticipating new variations of these parameters via data augmentation. Since every histological image originates from a unique data distribution, we propose to consider every histological slide of the training data as a domain and investigated the alternative approach of domain-adversarial training to learn features that are invariant to this available domain information. We carried out a comparative analysis with staining normalization and data augmentation on two different tasks: generalization to images acquired in unseen pathology labs for mitosis detection and generalization to unseen organs for nuclei segmentation. We report that the utility of each method depends on the type of task and type of data variability present at training and test time. The proposed framework for domain-adversarial training is able to improve generalization performances on top of conventional methods.},

  abstract = {A variety of recent works, spanning pruning, lottery tickets, and training within random subspaces, have shown that deep neural networks can be trained using far fewer degrees of freedom than the total number of parameters. We explain this phenomenon by first examining the success probability of hitting a training loss sublevel set when training within a random subspace of a given training dimensionality. We find a sharp phase transition in the success probability from 0 to 1 as the training dimension surpasses a threshold. This threshold training dimension increases as the desired final loss decreases, but decreases as the initial loss decreases. We then theoretically explain the origin of this phase transition, and its dependence on initialization and final desired loss, in terms of precise properties of the high dimensional geometry of the loss landscape. In particular, we show via Gordon's escape theorem, that the training dimension plus the Gaussian width of the desired loss sub-level set, projected onto a unit sphere surrounding the initialization, must exceed the total number of parameters for the success probability to be large. In several architectures and datasets, we measure the threshold training dimension as a function of initialization and demonstrate that it is a small fraction of the total number of parameters, thereby implying, by our theory, that successful training with so few dimensions is possible precisely because the Gaussian width of low loss sub-level sets is very large. Moreover, this threshold training dimension provides a strong null model for assessing the efficacy of more sophisticated ways to reduce training degrees of freedom, including lottery tickets as well a more optimal method we introduce: lottery subspaces.},

There are two main challenges for this task: 1) lack of aligned training pairs and 2) multiple possible outputs from a single input image. In this work, we present an approach based on disentangled representation for generating diverse outputs without paired training images. To synthesize diverse outputs, we propose to embed images onto two spaces: a domain-invariant content space capturing shared information across domains and a domain-specific attribute space. Our model takes the encoded content features extracted from a given input and attribute vectors sampled from the attribute space to synthesize diverse outputs at test time. To handle unpaired training data, we introduce a cross-cycle consistency loss based on disentangled representations. Qualitative results show that our model can generate diverse and realistic images on a wide range of tasks without paired training data. For quantitative evaluations, we measure realism with user study and Fr\textbackslash '\{e\}chet inception distance, and measure diversity with the perceptual distance metric, Jensen-Shannon divergence, and number of statistically-different bins.},

We use highly multiplexed tissue imaging, 3D reconstruction, spatial statistics, and machine learning to identify cell types and states underlying morphological features of known diagnostic and prognostic significance in colorectal cancer. Quantitation of these features in high-plex marker space reveals recurrent transitions from one tumor morphology to the next, some of which are coincident with longrange gradients in the expression of oncogenes and epigenetic regulators. At the tumor invasive margin, where tumor, normal, and immune cells compete, T cell suppression involves multiple cell types and 3D imaging shows that seemingly localized 2D features such as tertiary lymphoid structures are commonly interconnected and have graded molecular properties. Thus, while cancer genetics emphasizes the importance of discrete changes in tumor state, whole-specimen imaging reveals large-scale morphological and molecular gradients analogous to those in developing tissues.},

As a potential solution to these challenges, we present a deep learning-based approach making use of single image super-resolution (SISR) to reconstruct high-resolution histology images from low-resolution inputs. Such low-resolution images can easily be shared, require less storage, and can be acquired quickly using widely available low-cost slide scanners. The network consists of multi-scale fully convolutional networks capable of capturing hierarchical features. Conditional generative adversarial loss is incorporated to penalize blurriness in the output images. The network is trained using a progressive strategy where the scaling factor is sampled from a normal distribution with an increasing mean. The results are evaluated with quantitative metrics and are used in a clinical histopathology diagnosis procedure which shows that the SISR framework can be used to reconstruct high-resolution images with clinical level quality. We further propose a self-supervised color normalization method that can remove staining variation artifacts. Quantitative evaluations show that the SISR framework can generalize well on unseen data collected from other patient tissue cohorts by incorporating the color normalization method.},

  abstract = {Deep learning in the presence of noisy annotations has been studied extensively in classification, but much less in segmentation tasks. In this work, we study the learning dynamics of deep segmentation networks trained on inaccurately-annotated data. We discover a phenomenon that has been previously reported in the context of classification: the networks tend to first fit the clean pixel-level labels during an "early-learning" phase, before eventually memorizing the false annotations. However, in contrast to classification, memorization in segmentation does not arise simultaneously for all semantic categories. Inspired by these findings, we propose a new method for segmentation from noisy annotations with two key elements. First, we detect the beginning of the memorization phase separately for each category during training. This allows us to adaptively correct the noisy annotations in order to exploit early learning. Second, we incorporate a regularization term that enforces consistency across scales to boost robustness against annotation noise. Our method outperforms standard approaches on a medical-imaging segmentation task where noises are synthesized to mimic human annotation errors. It also provides robustness to realistic noisy annotations present in weakly-supervised semantic segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results on PASCAL VOC 2012.

  abstract = {Normalization techniques have become a basic component in modern convolutional neural networks (ConvNets). In particular, many recent works demonstrate that promoting the orthogonality of the weights helps train deep models and improve robustness. For ConvNets, most existing methods are based on penalizing or normalizing weight matrices derived from concatenating or flattening the convolutional kernels. These methods often destroy or ignore the benign convolutional structure of the kernels; therefore, they are often expensive or impractical for deep ConvNets. In contrast, we introduce a simple and efficient "Convolutional Normalization" (ConvNorm) method that can fully exploit the convolutional structure in the Fourier domain and serve as a simple plug-and-play module to be conveniently incorporated into any ConvNets. Our method is inspired by recent work on preconditioning methods for convolutional sparse coding and can effectively promote each layer's channel-wise isometry. Furthermore, we show that our ConvNorm can reduce the layerwise spectral norm of the weight matrices and hence improve the Lipschitzness of the network, leading to easier training and improved robustness for deep ConvNets. Applied to classification under noise corruptions and generative adversarial network (GAN), we show that the ConvNorm improves the robustness of common ConvNets such as ResNet and the performance of GAN. We verify our findings via numerical experiments on CIFAR and ImageNet.},

  abstract = {Normalization layers and activation functions are fundamental components in deep networks and typically co-locate with each other. Here we propose to design them using an automated approach. Instead of designing them separately, we unify them into a single tensor-to-tensor computation graph, and evolve its structure starting from basic mathematical functions. Examples of such mathematical functions are addition, multiplication and statistical moments. The use of low-level mathematical functions, in contrast to the use of high-level modules in mainstream NAS, leads to a highly sparse and large search space which can be challenging for search methods. To address the challenge, we develop efficient rejection protocols to quickly filter out candidate layers that do not work well. We also use multi-objective evolution to optimize each layer's performance across many architectures to prevent overfitting. Our method leads to the discovery of EvoNorms, a set of new normalization-activation layers with novel, and sometimes surprising structures that go beyond existing design patterns. For example, some EvoNorms do not assume that normalization and activation functions must be applied sequentially, nor need to center the feature maps, nor require explicit activation functions. Our experiments show that EvoNorms work well on image classification models including ResNets, MobileNets and EfficientNets but also transfer well to Mask R-CNN with FPN/SpineNet for instance segmentation and to BigGAN for image synthesis, outperforming BatchNorm and GroupNorm based layers in many cases.},

However, subsequent works have complicated the framework with new auxiliary tasks or extra pre-trained models, inevitably increasing computational overhead. This paper undertakes a fundamental analysis of MIM from the perspective of pixel reconstruction, which examines the input image patches and reconstruction target, and highlights two critical but previously overlooked bottlenecks. Based on this analysis, we propose a remarkably simple and effective method, \{\textbackslash ourmethod\}, that entails two strategies: 1) filtering the high-frequency components from the reconstruction target to de-emphasize the network's focus on texture-rich details and 2) adopting a conservative data transform strategy to alleviate the problem of missing foreground in MIM training. \{\textbackslash ourmethod\} can be easily integrated into most existing pixel-based MIM approaches (\textbackslash ie, using raw images as reconstruction target) with negligible additional computation. Without bells and whistles, our method consistently improves three MIM approaches, MAE, ConvMAE, and LSMAE, across various downstream tasks. We believe this effective plug-and-play method will serve as a strong baseline for self-supervised learning and provide insights for future improvements of the MIM framework.

Moreover, we propose a novel evaluation metric to properly measure the smoothness of latent style space of I2I translation models.

Previous works address this problem under the tenuous assumption that only a single shortcut exists in the training data. Real-world images are rife with multiple visual cues from background to texture. Key to advancing the reliability of vision systems is understanding whether existing methods can overcome multiple shortcuts or struggle in a Whac-A-Mole game, i.e., where mitigating one shortcut amplifies reliance on others. To address this shortcoming, we propose two benchmarks: 1) UrbanCars, a dataset with precisely controlled spurious cues, and 2) ImageNet-W, an evaluation set based on ImageNet for watermark, a shortcut we discovered affects nearly every modern vision model. Along with texture and background, ImageNet-W allows us to study multiple shortcuts emerging from training on natural images. We find computer vision models, including large foundation models -- regardless of training set, architecture, and supervision -- struggle when multiple shortcuts are present. Even methods explicitly designed to combat shortcuts struggle in a Whac-A-Mole dilemma. To tackle this challenge, we propose Last Layer Ensemble, a simple-yet-effective method to mitigate multiple shortcuts without Whac-A-Mole behavior. Our results surface multi-shortcut mitigation as an overlooked challenge critical to advancing the reliability of vision systems.

Currently, most works on unsupervised object discovery focus on slot-based approaches, which explicitly separate the latent representations of individual objects. While the result is easily interpretable, it usually requires the design of involved architectures. In contrast to this, we propose a comparatively simple approach - the Complex AutoEncoder (CAE) - that creates distributed object-centric representations. Following a coding scheme theorized to underlie object representations in biological neurons, its complex-valued activations represent two messages: their magnitudes express the presence of a feature, while the relative phase differences between neurons express which features should be bound together to create joint object representations. In contrast to previous approaches using complex-valued activations for object discovery, we present a fully unsupervised approach that is trained end-to-end - resulting in significant improvements in performance and efficiency. Further, we show that the CAE achieves competitive or better unsupervised object discovery performance on simple multi-object datasets compared to a state-of-the-art slot-based approach while being up to 100 times faster to train.},

  abstract = {Computational pathology is a domain that aims to develop algorithms to automatically analyze large digitized histopathology images, called whole slide images (WSI). WSIs are produced scanning thin tissue samples that are stained to make specific structures visible. They show stain colour heterogeneity due to different preparation and scanning settings applied across medical centers. Stain colour heterogeneity is a problem to train convolutional neural networks (CNN), the state-of-the-art algorithms for most computational pathology tasks, since CNNs usually underper-form when tested on images including different stain variations than those within data used to train the CNN. Despite several methods that were developed, stain colour hetero-geneity is still an unsolved challenge that limits the development of CNNs that can generalize on data from several medical centers. This paper aims to present a novel method to train CNNs that better generalize on data including several colour variations. The method, called H\&E-adversarial CNN, exploits H\&E matrix information to learn stain-invariant features during the training. The method is evaluated on the classification of colon and prostate histopathol-ogy images, involving eleven heterogeneous datasets, and compared with five other techniques used to handle stain colour heterogeneity. H\&E-adversarial CNNs show an improvement in performance compared to the other algorithms , demonstrating that it can help to better deal with stain colour heterogeneous images. * niccolo.marini@hevs.ch},

For such pretrained models, one may not have access to training data or test data. Moreover, one may not know details about the model, e.g., the specifics of the training data, the loss function, the hyperparameter values, etc. Given one or many pretrained models, it is a challenge to say anything about the expected performance or quality of the models. Here, we address this challenge by providing a detailed meta-analysis of hundreds of publicly available pretrained models. We examine norm-based capacity control metrics as well as power law based metrics from the recently-developed Theory of Heavy-Tailed Self Regularization. We find that norm based metrics correlate well with reported test accuracies for well-trained models, but that they often cannot distinguish well-trained versus poorly trained models. We also find that power law based metrics can do much better\textemdash quantitatively better at discriminating among series of well-trained models with a given architecture; and qualitatively better at discriminating well-trained versus poorly trained models. These methods can be used to identify when a pretrained neural network has problems that cannot be detected simply by examining training/test accuracies.},

However, deep neural networks are known to produce highly overconfident predictions on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Even if trained to be non-confident on OOD data, one can still adversarially manipulate OOD data so that the classifier again assigns high confidence to the manipulated samples. We show that two previously published defenses can be broken by better adapted attacks, highlighting the importance of robustness guarantees around OOD data. Since the existing method for this task is hard to train and significantly limits accuracy, we construct a classifier that can simultaneously achieve provably adversarially robust OOD detection and high clean accuracy. Moreover, by slightly modifying the classifier's architecture our method provably avoids the asymptotic overconfidence problem of standard neural networks. We provide code for all our experiments.},

  abstract = {In digital pathology, the final appearance of digitized images is affected by several factors, resulting in stain color and intensity variation. Stain normalization is an innovative solution to overcome stain variability. However, the validation of color normalization tools has been assessed only from a quantitative perspective, through the computation of similarity metrics between the original and normalized images. To the best of our knowledge, no works investigate the impact of normalization on the pathologist's evaluation. The objective of this paper is to propose a multi-tissue (i.e., breast, colon, liver, lung, and prostate) and multi-center qualitative analysis of a stain normalization tool with the involvement of pathologists with different years of experience. Two qualitative studies were carried out for this purpose: (i) a first study focused on the analysis of the perceived image quality and absence of significant image artifacts after the normalization process; (ii) a second study focused on the clinical score of the normalized image with respect to the original one. The results of the first study prove the high quality of the normalized image with a low impact artifact generation, while the second study demonstrates the superiority of the normalized image with respect to the original one in clinical practice. The normalization process can help both to reduce variability due to tissue staining procedures and facilitate the pathologist in the histological examination. The experimental results obtained in this work are encouraging and can justify the use of a stain normalization tool in clinical routine.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE The West German Study Group PlanB trial evaluated an anthracycline-free chemotherapy standard (six cycles of docetaxel and cyclophosphamide [TC]) in the routine treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2\textendash negative early breast cancer (EBC). PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with pT1 to pT4c, all pN+, and pN0/high-risk EBC were eligible. High-risk pN0 was defined by one or more of the following: pT greater than 2, grade 2 to 3, high urokinase-type plasminogen activator/plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, hormone receptor (HR) negativity, and less than 35 years of age. After an early amendment, all HR-positive tumors underwent recurrence score (RS) testing, with chemotherapy omission recommended in RS less than or equal to 11 pN0 to pN1 disease. Patients were randomly assigned to four cycles of epirubicin (E)90/cyclophoshamide (C)600 followed by four cycles of docetaxel (T)100 or six cycles of T75C600 (administered once every 3 weeks). The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS); secondary end points were overall survival (OS) and safety. The protocol specified P = .05 for a noninferiority margin of 4.4\% for all patients combined.

RESULTS Of the 3,198 registered patients, 348 (RS \# 11) omitted chemotherapy, and 401 were not randomly assigned. The intention-to-treat population included 2,449 patients (1,227 EC-T v 1,222 TC: postmenopausal, 62.2\% v 60.8\%; pN0, 58.2\% v 59.5\%; pT1, 57.6\% v 52.3\%; HR positive, 81.4\% v 82.2\%; RS greater than 25 [in HR-positive patients], 26.2\% v 27.5\%). Within the safety population (1,167 v 1,178 patients), 87.5\% v 93.0\% completed therapy. After a 60-month median follow-up, 5-year outcomes were similar in the EC-T and TC arms (DFS, 89.6\% [95\% CI, 87.9\% to 91.5\%] v 89.9\% [95\% CI, 88.1\% to 91.8\%]; OS, 94.5\% [95\% CI, 93.1\% to 95.9\%] v 94.7\% [95\% CI, 93.3\% to 96.1\%]). The DFS difference was within the noninferiority margin of the original trial design. Five treatment-related deaths were reported for TC (one for EC-T), despite a trend toward more-severe adverse events in the latter. Interaction analysis revealed no predictive trends with respect to key factors, including triple-negative, luminal A/B-like, pN, age, and RS status. CONCLUSION In the West German Study Group PlanB trial, 5-year outcomes for TC and EC-T were equally excellent. Six cycles of TC is an effective/safe option in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2\textendash negative EBC with pN0 high genomic risk or pN1 EBC with genomically intermediate- to high-risk disease.},

We demonstrate the use of conformal prediction to detect unreliable predictions, using histopathological diagnosis and grading of prostate biopsies as example. We digitized 7788 prostate biopsies from 1192 men in the STHLM3 diagnostic study, used for training, and 3059 biopsies from 676 men used for testing. With conformal prediction, 1 in 794 (0.1\%) predictions is incorrect for cancer diagnosis (compared to 14 errors [2\%] without conformal prediction) while 175 (22\%) of the predictions are flagged as unreliable when the AI-system is presented with new data from the same lab and scanner that it was trained on. Conformal prediction could with small samples (N\,=\,49 for external scanner, N\,=\,10 for external lab and scanner, and N\,=\,12 for external lab, scanner and pathology assessment) detect systematic differences in external data leading to worse predictive performance. The AI-system with conformal prediction commits 3 (2\%) errors for cancer detection in cases of atypical prostate tissue compared to 44 (25\%) without conformal prediction, while the system flags 143 (80\%) unreliable predictions. We conclude that conformal prediction can increase patient safety of AI-systems.},

A pervasive approach for synthesizing target images involves one-shot mapping through generative adversarial networks (GAN). Yet, GAN models that implicitly characterize the image distribution can suffer from limited sample fidelity. Here, we propose a novel method based on adversarial diffusion modeling, SynDiff, for improved performance in medical image translation. To capture a direct correlate of the image distribution, SynDiff leverages a conditional diffusion process that progressively maps noise and source images onto the target image. For fast and accurate image sampling during inference, large diffusion steps are taken with adversarial projections in the reverse diffusion direction. To enable training on unpaired datasets, a cycle-consistent architecture is devised with coupled diffusive and non-diffusive modules that bilaterally translate between two modalities. Extensive assessments are reported on the utility of SynDiff against competing GAN and diffusion models in multicontrast MRI and MRI-CT translation. Our demonstrations indicate that SynDiff offers quantitatively and qualitatively superior performance against competing baselines.},

We present fundamental explanations to help better understand the nature of MSAs. In particular, we demonstrate the following properties of MSAs and Vision Transformers (ViTs): (1) MSAs improve not only accuracy but also generalization by flattening the loss landscapes. Such improvement is primarily attributable to their data specificity, not long-range dependency. On the other hand, ViTs suffer from non-convex losses. Large datasets and loss landscape smoothing methods alleviate this problem; (2) MSAs and Convs exhibit opposite behaviors. For example, MSAs are low-pass filters, but Convs are high-pass filters. Therefore, MSAs and Convs are complementary; (3) Multi-stage neural networks behave like a series connection of small individual models. In addition, MSAs at the end of a stage play a key role in prediction. Based on these insights, we propose AlterNet, a model in which Conv blocks at the end of a stage are replaced with MSA blocks. AlterNet outperforms CNNs not only in large data regimes but also in small data regimes. The code is available at https://github.com/xxxnell/how-do-vits-work.},

Many approaches in the field focus on the continuous relaxation of a specific task and show promising results in this context. But the focus on single tasks also limits the applicability of the proposed concepts to a narrow range of applications. In this work, we build on those ideas to propose an approach that allows to integrate algorithms into end-to-end trainable neural network architectures based on a general approximation of discrete conditions. To this end, we relax these conditions in control structures such as conditional statements, loops, and indexing, so that resulting algorithms are smoothly differentiable. To obtain meaningful gradients, each relevant variable is perturbed via logistic distributions and the expectation value under this perturbation is approximated. We evaluate the proposed continuous relaxation model on four challenging tasks and show that it can keep up with relaxations specifically designed for each individual task.},

  abstract = {Many current neural networks for medical imaging generalise poorly to data unseen during training. Such behaviour can be caused by networks overfitting easy-to-learn, or statistically dominant, features while disregarding other potentially informative features. For example, indistinguishable differences in the sharpness of the images from two different scanners can degrade the performance of the network significantly. All neural networks intended for clinical practice need to be robust to variation in data caused by differences in imaging equipment, sample preparation and patient populations. To address these challenges, we evaluate the utility of spectral decoupling as an implicit bias mitigation method. Spectral decoupling encourages the neural network to learn more features by simply regularising the networks' unnormalised prediction scores with an L2 penalty, thus having no added computational costs. We show that spectral decoupling allows training neural networks on datasets with strong spurious correlations and increases networks' robustness for data distribution shifts. To validate our findings, we train networks with and without spectral decoupling to detect prostate cancer tissue slides and COVID-19 in chest radiographs. Networks trained with spectral decoupling achieve up to 9.5 percent point higher performance on external datasets. Our results show that spectral decoupling helps with generalisation issues associated with neural networks, and can be used to complement or replace computationally expensive explicit bias mitigation methods, such as stain normalization in histological images. We recommend using spectral decoupling as an implicit bias mitigation method in any neural network intended for clinical use.},

In extensive experiments on ResNet and EfficientNet models, we find that three components are crucial for increasing performance with self-learning: (i) using short update times between the teacher and the student network, (ii) fine-tuning only few affine parameters distributed across the network, and (iii) leveraging methods from robust classification to counteract the effect of label noise. We use these insights to obtain drastically improved state-of-the-art results on ImageNet-C (22.0\% mCE), ImageNet-R (17.4\% error) and ImageNet-A (14.8\% error). Our techniques yield further improvements in combination with previously proposed robustification methods. Self-learning is able to reduce the top-1 error to a point where no substantial further progress can be expected. We therefore re-purpose the dataset from the Visual Domain Adaptation Challenge 2019 and use a subset of it as a new robustness benchmark (ImageNet-D) which proves to be a more challenging dataset for all current state-of-the-art models (58.2\% error) to guide future research efforts at the intersection of robustness and domain adaptation on ImageNet scale.},

  abstract = {This paper develops a unified framework for image-to-image translation based on conditional diffusion models and evaluates this framework on four challenging image-to-image translation tasks, namely colorization, inpainting, uncropping, and JPEG restoration. Our simple implementation of image-to-image diffusion models outperforms strong GAN and regression baselines on all tasks, without task-specific hyper-parameter tuning, architecture customization, or any auxiliary loss or sophisticated new techniques needed. We uncover the impact of an L2 vs. L1 loss in the denoising diffusion objective on sample diversity, and demonstrate the importance of self-attention in the neural architecture through empirical studies. Importantly, we advocate a unified evaluation protocol based on ImageNet, with human evaluation and sample quality scores (FID, Inception Score, Classification Accuracy of a pre-trained ResNet-50, and Perceptual Distance against original images). We expect this standardized evaluation protocol to play a role in advancing image-to-image translation research. Finally, we show that a generalist, multi-task diffusion model performs as well or better than task-specific specialist counterparts.

Using six datasets from four different institutions digitized by different scanner systems, we systematically explore artifacts' influence on the accuracy of the pre-trained, validated, deep learning-based model for prostate cancer detection in histological slides. We provide evidence that any histological artifact dependent on severity can lead to a substantial loss in model performance.

However, the current MIL methods are usually based on independent and identical distribution hypothesis, thus neglect the correlation among different instances. To address this problem, we proposed a new framework, called correlated MIL, and provided a proof for convergence. Based on this framework, we devised a Transformer based MIL (TransMIL), which explored both morphological and spatial information. The proposed TransMIL can effectively deal with unbalanced/balanced and binary/multiple classification with great visualization and interpretability. We conducted various experiments for three different computational pathology problems and achieved better performance and faster convergence compared with state-of-the-art methods. The test AUC for the binary tumor classification can be up to 93.09\% over CAMELYON16 dataset.

  abstract = {Whole-Slide Histopathology Image (WSI) is generally considered the gold standard for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Given the large inter-operator variation among pathologists, there is an imperative need to develop machine learning models based on WSIs for consistently predicting patient prognosis. The existing WSI-based prediction methods do not utilize the ordinal ranking loss to train the prognosis model, and thus cannot model the strong ordinal information among different patients in an efficient way. Another challenge is that a WSI is of large size (e.g., 100,000-by-100,000 pixels) with heterogeneous patterns but often only annotated with a single WSI-level label, which further complicates the training process. To address these challenges, we consider the ordinal characteristic of the survival process by adding a ranking-based regularization term on the Cox model and propose a weakly supervised deep ordinal Cox model (BDOCOX) for survival prediction from WSIs. Here, we generate amounts of bags from WSIs, and each bag is comprised of the image patches representing the heterogeneous patterns of WSIs, which is assumed to match the WSI-level labels for training the proposed model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is well validated by theoretical analysis as well as the prognosis and patient stratification results on three cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).},

We propose several manifestations for training neural networks, including algorithmic examples (via hyper-parameters and loss functions), data-based examples, and model-based examples. Specifically, we introduce several novel techniques: cyclical weight decay, cyclical batch size, cyclical focal loss, cyclical softmax temperature, cyclical data augmentation, cyclical gradient clipping, and cyclical semi-supervised learning. In addition, we demonstrate that cyclical weight decay, cyclical softmax temperature, and cyclical gradient clipping (as three examples of this principle) are beneficial in the test accuracy performance of a trained model. Furthermore, we discuss model-based examples (such as pretraining and knowledge distillation) from the perspective of general cyclical training and recommend some changes to the typical training methodology. In summary, this paper defines the general cyclical training concept and discusses several specific ways in which this concept can be applied to training neural networks.

MaskTune forces the trained model to explore new features during a single epoch finetuning by masking previously discovered features. MaskTune, unlike earlier approaches for mitigating shortcut learning, does not require any supervision, such as annotating spurious features or labels for subgroup samples in a dataset. Our empirical results on biased MNIST, CelebA, Waterbirds, and ImagenNet-9L datasets show that MaskTune is effective on tasks that often suffer from the existence of spurious correlations. Finally, we show that MaskTune outperforms or achieves similar performance to the competing methods when applied to the selective classification (classification with rejection option) task.

For (i), we treat unmasked pixels as sparse voxels of 3D point clouds and use sparse convolution to encode. This is the first use of sparse convolution for 2D masked modeling. For (ii), we develop a hierarchical decoder to reconstruct images from multi-scale encoded features. Our method called Sparse masKed modeling (SparK) is general: it can be used directly on any convolutional model without backbone modifications. We validate it on both classical (ResNet) and modern (ConvNeXt) models: on three downstream tasks, it surpasses both state-of-the-art contrastive learning and transformer-based masked modeling by similarly large margins (around +1.0\%). Improvements on object detection and instance segmentation are more substantial (up to +3.5\%), verifying the strong transferability of features learned. We also find its favorable scaling behavior by observing more gains on larger models. All this evidence reveals a promising future of generative pre-training on convnets.

Many algorithms in the field of digital pathology are concerned with the expression of a single stain, thus stain separation is a key preprocessing step in these situations. We present a new versatile method of stain separation. The method uses Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to determine a set of statistically independent vectors, corresponding to the individual stain expressions. In comparison to other popular approaches, such as PCA and NNMF, we found that ICA gives a superior projection of the data with respect to each stain. In addition, we introduce a correction step to improve the initial results provided by the ICA coefficients. Many existing approaches only consider separation of two stains, with primary emphasis on Haematoxylin and Eosin. We show that our method is capable of making a good separation when there are more than two stains present. We also demonstrate our method's ability to achieve good separation on a variety of different stain types.},

However, multimodal models still often consist of many task- and modality-specific pieces and training procedures. For example, CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) trains independent text and image towers via a contrastive loss. We explore an additional unification: the use of a pure pixel-based model to perform image, text, and multimodal tasks. Our model is trained with contrastive loss alone, so we call it CLIP-Pixels Only (CLIPPO). CLIPPO uses a single encoder that processes both regular images and text rendered as images. CLIPPO performs image-based tasks such as retrieval and zero-shot image classification almost as well as CLIP, with half the number of parameters and no text-specific tower or embedding. When trained jointly via image-text contrastive learning and next-sentence contrastive learning, CLIPPO can perform well on natural language understanding tasks, without any word-level loss (language modelling or masked language modelling), outperforming pixel-based prior work. Surprisingly, CLIPPO can obtain good accuracy in visual question answering, simply by rendering the question and image together. Finally, we exploit the fact that CLIPPO does not require a tokenizer to show that it can achieve strong performance on multilingual multimodal retrieval without},

We present MultiSurv, a multimodal deep learning method for long-term pan-cancer survival prediction. MultiSurv is composed of three main modules. A feature representation module includes a dedicated submodel for each input data modality. A data fusion layer aggregates the multimodal representations. Finally, a prediction submodel yields conditional survival probabilities for a predefined set of follow-up time intervals. We trained MultiSurv on clinical, imaging, and four different high-dimensional omics data modalities from patients diagnosed with one of 33 different cancer types. We evaluated unimodal input configurations against several previous methods and different multimodal data combinations. MultiSurv achieved the best results according to different time-dependent metrics and delivered highly accurate long-term patient survival curves. The best performance was obtained when combining clinical information with either gene expression or DNA methylation data, depending on the evaluation metric. Additionally, MultiSurv can handle missing data, including missing values and complete data modalitites. Interestingly, for unimodal data we found that simpler modeling approaches, including the classical Cox proportional hazards method, can achieve results rivaling those of more complex methods for certain data modalities. We also show how the learned feature representations of MultiSurv can be used to visualize relationships between cancer types and individual patients, after embedding into a low-dimensional space.},

Digital Pathology is an area prone to high variability due to many sources, including the common practice of evaluating several consecutive tissue sections stained with different staining protocols. Obtaining labels for each stain is very expensive and time consuming as it requires a high level of domain knowledge. In this article, we propose an unsupervised augmentation approach based on adversarial image-to-image translation, which facilitates the training of stain invariant supervised convolutional neural networks. By training the network on one commonly used staining modality and applying it to images that include corresponding, but differently stained, tissue structures, the presented method demonstrates significant improvements over other approaches. These benefits are illustrated in the problem of glomeruli segmentation in seven different staining modalities (PAS, Jones H\&E, CD68, Sirius Red, CD34, H\&E and CD3) and analysis of the learned representations demonstrate their stain invariance.},

We formulate the augmentation process as a latent variable model by postulating a partition of the latent representation into a content component, which is assumed invariant to augmentation, and a style component, which is allowed to change. Unlike prior work on disentanglement and independent component analysis, we allow for both nontrivial statistical and causal dependencies in the latent space. We study the identifiability of the latent representation based on pairs of views of the observations and prove sufficient conditions that allow us to identify the invariant content partition up to an invertible mapping in both generative and discriminative settings. We find numerical simulations with dependent latent variables are consistent with our theory. Lastly, we introduce Causal3DIdent, a dataset of high-dimensional, visually complex images with rich causal dependencies, which we use to study the effect of data augmentations performed in practice.},

While code and data availability are essential to reproduce findings from preceding publications, ensuring a deep learning model's reusability is more challenging. For that, the codebase should be well-documented and easy to integrate in existing workflows, and models should be robust towards noise and generalizable towards data from different sources. Strikingly, only a few computational pathology algorithms have been reused by other researchers so far, let alone employed in a clinical setting.           To assess the current state of reproducibility and reusability of computational pathology algorithms, we evaluated peer-reviewed articles available in Pubmed, published between January 2019 and March 2021, in five use cases: stain normalization, tissue type segmentation, evaluation of cell-level features, genetic alteration prediction, and direct extraction of grading, staging, and prognostic information. We compiled criteria for data and code availability, and for statistical result analysis and assessed them in 161 publications. We found that only one quarter (42 out of 161 publications) made code publicly available and thus fulfilled our minimum requirement for reproducibility and reusability. Among these 42 papers, three quarters (30 out of 42) analyzed their results statistically, less than half (20 out of 42) have released their trained model weights, and only about a third (16 out of 42) used an independent cohort for evaluation.           This review highlights candidates for reproducible and reusable algorithms in computational pathology. It is intended for both pathologists interested in deep learning, and researchers applying deep learning algorithms to computational pathology challenges.

These color shifts result in a poor generalization of deep learning-based methods from the training domain to external pathology data. To increase test performance, stain normalization techniques are used to reduce the variance between training and test domain. Alternatively, color augmentation can be applied during training leading to a more robust model without the extra step of color normalization at test time. We propose a novel color augmentation technique, HistAuGAN, that can simulate a wide variety of realistic histology stain colors, thus making neural networks stain-invariant when applied during training. Based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) for image-to-image translation, our model disentangles the content of the image, i.e., the morphological tissue structure, from the stain color attributes. It can be trained on multiple domains and, therefore, learns to cover different stain colors as well as other domain-specific variations introduced in the slide preparation and imaging process. We demonstrate that HistAuGAN outperforms conventional color augmentation techniques on a classification task on the publicly available dataset Camelyon17 and show that it is able to mitigate present batch effects.},

In this work, we propose a novel noisy label learning framework ProMix that attempts to maximize the utility of clean samples for boosted performance. Key to our method, we propose a matched high-confidence selection technique that selects those examples having high confidence and matched prediction with its given labels. Combining with the small-loss selection, our method is able to achieve a precision of 99.27 and a recall of 98.22 in detecting clean samples on the CIFAR-10N dataset. Based on such a large set of clean data, ProMix improves the best baseline method by +2.67\% on CIFAR-10N and +1.61\% on CIFAR-100N datasets.

Specifically, a high-order degradation modeling process is introduced to better simulate complex real-world degradations. We also consider the common ringing and overshoot artifacts in the synthesis process. In addition, we employ a U-Net discriminator with spectral normalization to increase discriminator capability and stabilize the training dynamics. Extensive comparisons have shown its superior visual performance than prior works on various real datasets. We also provide efficient implementations to synthesize training pairs on the fly.},

We characterized neuron-types, hubs, feedforward and feedback pathways, and cross-hemisphere and brain-nerve cord interactions. We found pervasive multisensory and interhemispheric integration, highly recurrent architecture, abundant feedback from descending neurons, and multiple novel circuit motifs. The brain's most recurrent circuits comprised the input and output neurons of the learning center. Some structural features, including multilayer shortcuts and nested recurrent loops, resembled powerful machine learning architectures.

In particular, multi-modal omics data get now employed in addition to clinical data to stratify patients according to their clinical outcomes. Despite some recent work on benchmarking multi-modal integration strategies for cancer survival prediction, there is still a need for the standardization of the results of model performances and for the consecutive exploration of the relative performance of statistical and deep learning models. Here, we propose a unique benchmark, SurvBoard, which standardizes several important experimental design choices to enable comparability between cancer survival models that incorporate multi-omics data. By designing several benchmarking scenarios, SurvBoard allows for the comparison of single-cancer models and models trained on pan-cancer data; SurvBoard also makes it possible to investigate the added value of using patient data with missing modalities. Additionally, in this work, we point out several potential pitfalls that might arise during the preprocessing and validation of multi-omics cancer survival models and address them in our benchmark. We compare statistical and deep learning models revealing that statistical models often outperform deep learning models, particularly in terms of model calibration. Finally, we offer a web service that enables quick model evaluation against our benchmark (https://www.survboard.science/).

The main advantage of our approach is that the guidance during the denoising process is done by an external gradient. Consequently, the diffusion model does not need to be retrained for the different tasks on the same dataset. We apply our method to simulate the aging process on facial photos using a regression task, as well as on a brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging dataset for the simulation of brain tumor growth. Furthermore, we use a segmentation model to inpaint tumors at the desired location in healthy slices of brain MR images. We achieve convincing results for all problems.},

For example, modern ConvNets, represented by ConvNeXt, have demonstrated strong performance in various scenarios. While these models were originally designed for supervised learning with ImageNet labels, they can also potentially benefit from self-supervised learning techniques such as masked autoencoders (MAE). However, we found that simply combining these two approaches leads to subpar performance. In this paper, we propose a fully convolutional masked autoencoder framework and a new Global Response Normalization (GRN) layer that can be added to the ConvNeXt architecture to enhance inter-channel feature competition. This co-design of self-supervised learning techniques and architectural improvement results in a new model family called ConvNeXt V2, which significantly improves the performance of pure ConvNets on various recognition benchmarks, including ImageNet classification, COCO detection, and ADE20K segmentation. We also provide pre-trained ConvNeXt V2 models of various sizes, ranging from an efficient 3.7M-parameter Atto model with 76.7\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, to a 650M Huge model that achieves a state-of-the-art 88.9\% accuracy using only public training data.},

The commonly-adopted formulation of the latent code of diffusion models is a sequence of gradually denoised samples, as opposed to the simpler (e.g., Gaussian) latent space of GANs, VAEs, and normalizing flows. This paper provides an alternative, Gaussian formulation of the latent space of various diffusion models, as well as an invertible DPM-Encoder that maps images into the latent space. While our formulation is purely based on the definition of diffusion models, we demonstrate several intriguing consequences. (1) Empirically, we observe that a common latent space emerges from two diffusion models trained independently on related domains. In light of this finding, we propose CycleDiffusion, which uses DPM-Encoder for unpaired image-to-image translation. Furthermore, applying CycleDiffusion to text-to-image diffusion models, we show that large-scale text-to-image diffusion models can be used as zero-shot image-to-image editors. (2) One can guide pre-trained diffusion models and GANs by controlling the latent codes in a unified, plug-and-play formulation based on energy-based models. Using the CLIP model and a face recognition model as guidance, we demonstrate that diffusion models have better coverage of low-density sub-populations and individuals than GANs.},

  abstract = {We propose focal modulation networks (FocalNets in short), where self-attention (SA) is completely replaced by a focal modulation mechanism for modeling token interactions in vision. Focal modulation comprises three components: (i) hierarchical contextualization, implemented using a stack of depth-wise convolutional layers, to encode visual contexts from short to long ranges, (ii) gated aggregation to selectively gather contexts for each query token based on its content, and (iii) element-wise modulation or affine transformation to inject the aggregated context into the query. Extensive experiments show FocalNets outperform the state-of-theart SA counterparts (e.g., Swin and Focal Transformers) with similar computational cost on the tasks of image classification, object detection, and segmentation. Specifically, FocalNets with tiny and base size achieve 82.3\% and 83.9\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K. After pretrained on ImageNet-22K in 2242 resolution, it attains 86.5\% and 87.3\% top-1 accuracy when finetuned with resolution 2242 and 3842, respectively. When transferred to downstream tasks, FocalNets exhibit clear superiority. For object detection with Mask R-CNN [29], FocalNet base trained with 1\texttimes{} outperforms the Swin counterpart by 2.1 points and already surpasses Swin trained with 3\texttimes{} schedule (49.0 v.s. 48.5). For semantic segmentation with UPerNet [90], FocalNet base at single-scale outperforms Swin by 2.4, and beats Swin at multiscale (50.5 v.s. 49.7). Using large FocalNet and Mask2former [13], we achieve 58.5 mIoU for ADE20K semantic segmentation, and 57.9 PQ for COCO Panoptic Segmentation. Using huge FocalNet and DINO [106], we achieved 64.2 and 64.3 mAP on COCO minival and test-dev, respectively, establishing new SoTA on top of much larger attention-based models like Swinv2-G [53] and BEIT-3 [84].

  abstract = {Deep AUC Maximization (DAM) is a new paradigm for learning a deep neural network by maximizing the AUC score of the model on a dataset. Most previous works of AUC maximization focus on the perspective of optimization by designing efficient stochastic algorithms, and studies on generalization performance of large-scale DAM on difficult tasks are missing. In this work, we aim to make DAM more practical for interesting real-world applications (e.g., medical image classification). First, we propose a new margin-based min-max surrogate loss function for the AUC score (named as AUC min-max-margin loss or simply AUC margin loss for short). It is more robust than the commonly used AUC square loss, while enjoying the same advantage in terms of large-scale stochastic optimization. Second, we conduct extensive empirical studies of our DAM method on four difficult medical image classification tasks, namely (i) classification of chest x-ray images for identifying many threatening diseases, (ii) classification of images of skin lesions for identifying melanoma, (iii) classification of mammogram for breast cancer screening, and (iv) classification of microscopic images for identifying tumor tissue. Our studies demonstrate that the proposed DAM method improves the performance of optimizing cross-entropy loss by a large margin, and also achieves better performance than optimizing the existing AUC square loss on these medical image classification tasks. Specifically, our DAM method has achieved the 1st place on Stanford CheXpert competition on Aug. 31, 2020. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that makes DAM succeed on large-scale medical image datasets. We also conduct extensive ablation studies to demonstrate the advantages of the new AUC margin loss over the AUC square loss on benchmark datasets. The proposed method is implemented in our open-sourced library LibAUC (www.libauc.org).},

We proposed Megabyte, a multi-scale decoder architecture that enables end-to-end differentiable modeling of sequences of over one million bytes. Megabyte segments sequences into patches and uses a local submodel within patches and a global model between patches. This enables sub-quadratic self-attention, much larger feedforward layers for the same compute, and improved parallelism during decoding -- unlocking better performance at reduced cost for both training and generation. Extensive experiments show that Megabyte allows byte-level models to perform competitively with subword models on long context language modeling, achieve state-of-the-art density estimation on ImageNet, and model audio from raw files. Together, these results establish the viability of tokenization-free autoregressive sequence modeling at scale.},

  abstract = {Ever since Reddi et al. (2018) pointed out the divergence issue of Adam, many new variants have been designed to obtain convergence. However, vanilla Adam remains exceptionally popular and it works well in practice. Why is there a gap between theory and practice? We point out there is a mismatch between the settings of theory and practice: Reddi et al. (2018) pick the problem after picking the hyperparameters of Adam, i.e., ({$\beta$}1, {$\beta$}2); while practical applications often fix the problem first and then tune ({$\beta$}1, {$\beta$}2). Due to this observation, we conjecture that the empirical convergence can be theoretically justified, only if we change the order of picking the problem and hyperparameter. In this work, we confirm this conjecture. We prove that, wh{$\surd$}en the 2nd-order momentum parameter {$\beta$}2 is large and 1st-order momentum parameter {$\beta$}1 {$<$} {$\beta$}2 {$<$} 1, Adam converges to the neighborhood of critical points. The size of the neighborhood is propositional to the variance of stochastic gradients. Under an extra condition (strong growth condition), Adam converges to critical points. It is worth mentioning that our results cover a wide range of hyperparameters: as {$\beta$}2 increases, our convergence result can cover any {$\beta$}1 {$\in$} [0, 1) including {$\beta$}1 = 0.9, which is the default setting in deep learning libraries. To our knowledge, this is the first result showing that Adam can converge without any modification on its update rules. Further, our analysis does not require assumptions of bounded gradients or bounded 2nd-order momentum. When {$\beta$}2 is small, we further point out a large region of ({$\beta$}1, {$\beta$}2) combinations where Adam can diverge to infinity. Our divergence result considers the same setting (fixing the optimization problem ahead) as our convergence result, indicating that there is a phase transition from divergence to convergence when increasing {$\beta$}2. These positive and negative results provide suggestions on how to tune Adam hyperparame{$\surd$}ters: for instance, when Adam does not work well, we suggest tuning up {$\beta$}2 and trying {$\beta$}1 {$<$} {$\beta$}2.},

  abstract = {Color inconsistency is an inevitable challenge in computational pathology, which generally happens because of stain intensity variations or sections scanned by different scanners. It harms the pathological image analysis methods, especially the learning-based models. A series of approaches have been proposed for stain normalization. However, most of them are lack of flexibility in practice. In this paper, we formulated stain normalization as a digital re-staining process and proposed a self-supervised learning model, which is called RestainNet. Our network is regarded as a digital re-stainer which learns how to re-stain an unstained (grayscale) image. Two digital stains, Hematoxylin (H) and Eosin (E), were extracted from the original image by Beer-Lambert's Law. We proposed a staining loss to maintain the correctness of stain intensity during the restaining process. Thanks to the self-supervised nature, paired training samples are no longer necessary, which demonstrates great flexibility in practical usage. Our RestainNet outperforms existing approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performance with regard to color correctness and structure preservation. We further conducted experiments on the segmentation and classification tasks and the proposed RestainNet achieved outstanding performance compared with SOTA methods. The self-supervised design allows the network learn any staining style with no extra effort.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of domain generalization in semantic segmentation, which aims to learn a robust model using only labeled synthetic (source) data. The model is expected to perform well on unseen real (target) domains. Our study finds that the image style variation can largely influence the model's performance and the style features can be well represented by the channel-wise mean and standard deviation of images. Inspired by this, we propose a novel adversarial style augmentation (AdvStyle) approach, which can dynamically generate hard stylized images during training and thus can effectively prevent the model from overfitting on the source domain. Specifically, AdvStyle regards the style feature as a learnable parameter and updates it by adversarial training. The learned adversarial style feature is used to construct an adversarial image for robust model training. AdvStyle is easy to implement and can be readily applied to different models. Experiments on two synthetic-to-real semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that AdvStyle can significantly improve the model performance on unseen real domains and show that we can achieve the state of the art. Moreover, AdvStyle can be employed to domain generalized image classification and produces a clear improvement on the considered datasets.},

  abstract = {The success of language Transformers is primarily attributed to the pretext task of masked language modeling (MLM) (Devlin et al., 2019), where texts are first tokenized into semantically meaningful pieces. In this work, we study masked image modeling (MIM) and indicate the advantages and challenges of using a semantically meaningful visual tokenizer. We present a self-supervised framework iBOT that can perform masked prediction with an online tokenizer. Specifically, we perform self-distillation on masked patch tokens and take the teacher network as the online tokenizer, along with self-distillation on the class token to acquire visual semantics. The online tokenizer is jointly learnable with the MIM objective and dispenses with a multi-stage training pipeline where the tokenizer needs to be pretrained beforehand. We show the prominence of iBOT by achieving an 81.7\% linear probing accuracy and an 86.3\% fine-tuning accuracy evaluated on ImageNet1K. Beyond the state-of-the-art image classification results, we underline emerging local semantic patterns, which helps the models to obtain strong robustness against common corruptions and achieve leading results on dense downstream tasks, e.g., object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. The code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/bytedance/ibot.},

  abstract = {Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) has a high recurrence and metastasis rate. Factors influencing recurrence and metastasis are currently unknown and there are no distinct histopathological or morphological features indicating the risks of recurrence and metastasis in LSCC. Our study focuses on the recurrence prediction of LSCC based on H\&E-stained histopathological whole-slide images (WSI). Due to the small size of LSCC cohorts in terms of patients with available recurrence information, standard end-to-end learning with various convolutional neural networks for this task tends to overfit. Also, the predictions made by these models are hard to interpret. Histopathology WSIs are typically very large and are therefore processed as a set of smaller tiles. In this work, we propose a novel conditional self-supervised learning (SSL) method to learn representations of WSI at the tile level first, and leverage clustering algorithms to identify the tiles with similar histopathological representations. The resulting representations and clusters from self-supervision are used as features of a survival model for recurrence prediction at the patient level. Using two publicly available datasets from TCGA and CPTAC, we show that our LSCC recurrence prediction survival model outperforms both LSCC pathological stage-based approach and machine learning baselines such as multiple instance learning. The proposed method also enables us to explain the recurrence histopathological risk factors via the derived clusters. This can help pathologists derive new hypotheses regarding morphological features associated with LSCC recurrence.},

  abstract = {While early AutoML frameworks focused on optimizing traditional ML pipelines and their hyperparameters, a recent trend in AutoML is to focus on neural architecture search. In this paper, we introduce Auto-PyTorch, which brings the best of these two worlds together by jointly and robustly optimizing the architecture of networks and the training hyperparameters to enable fully automated deep learning (AutoDL). Auto-PyTorch achieves state-of-the-art performance on several tabular benchmarks by combining multi-fidelity optimization with portfolio construction for warmstarting and ensembling of deep neural networks (DNNs) and common baselines for tabular data. To thoroughly study our assumptions on how to design such an AutoDL system, we additionally introduce a new benchmark on learning curves for DNNs, dubbed LCBench, and run extensive ablation studies of the full Auto-PyTorch on typical AutoML benchmarks, eventually showing that Auto-PyTorch performs better than several state-of-the-art competitors on average.},
